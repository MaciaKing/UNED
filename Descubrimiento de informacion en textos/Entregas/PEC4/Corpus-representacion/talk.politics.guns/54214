I'm actually going to assume thatthis was a serious posting, fool that I am.In article <1993Apr18.001319.2340@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu> jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu writes:>Yea, there are millions of cases where yoy *say* that firearms>'deter' criminals. Alas, this is not provable. I think that that>there are actually *few* cases where this is so.And I suppose I should just take your word for it. Did you everthink that many people who use firearms to protect themselvesmight not admit to it because of the ridiculous laws which existforbidding concealed carry?>The bulk of firarems are used against unworthy and unnesessary>opponents ... those who posessa a cool jakcet you want, those who>would argue with you about a parking space, those who would>take your woman. In short, trivial and worthless causes.I already own a cool jacket. I ride a bicycle to work and parkit behind my desk. And if my woman decides to go with someoneelse, I'd be disappointed but killing her new suitor will probablynot endear her to me any more than before. Frankly, I've nevermet a woman worth killing for anyway. (Now, an AR-15 with a chromebarrel, THAT's worth killing for ...!-))>Too much of this has ruined you cause. There is no recovery.>In the near future, federal martials will come for your arms.>No one will help you. You are more dangerous, to their thinking,>than the 'criminal'. This is your own fault.Does this pinhead know something the rest of us don't?I'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns.The government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail sincethey don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-burdened anyway. Where are they going to put all the millions ofgun-owners who won't fork over their weapons? Maybe you'd like tovolunteer the services of your humble abode, since you obviouslyfeel sooooo strongly about this.>The 2nd amendment is dead. Accept this.
