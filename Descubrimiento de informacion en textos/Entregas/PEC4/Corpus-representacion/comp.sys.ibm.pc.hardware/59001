Husak - husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu - Univerisity of IllinoisDoes it do it to all tapes?  Were the two tapes that it unwound of the sametype from the same batch?  The reason I ask is that I bought some generic tapesthat did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out andhad closed the little marker hole.  It was only on a few tapes of a set.Did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels?If you have not yet, open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom ofthe tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.As you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any morethan you have to.  As you are doing it, look for a couple of little holes inthe tape.  These are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it isat the end of the tape.  The holes are spaced a couple of inches apart.  My bestguess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the secondmarker?Anyhow, If the tape has the holes, then check to see if the mirror on the tapeis clean.  The function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes.  Thetape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area wherethe reflection would come out.  When the hole goes by, the pickup detects thelight that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop.  If the mirror is dirtyor out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might havea problem detecting the end of the tape.If the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good, then eitherthe pickup or the LED of the sensor system has failed or is dirty.  If you openthe drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the R/W headassembly.  If it looks clean and nothing is in its way, then the drive mayneed to be serviced.  It is possible that the LED is burned out or the sensoris out.If it is still in warranty, you might be able to send it back to CMS forrepair.---Scott Hileswhiles@relay.nswc.navy.milStandard disclaimer:The opinions expressed are those of my own and do not necessarilyreflect those of the DOD or the Navy.
