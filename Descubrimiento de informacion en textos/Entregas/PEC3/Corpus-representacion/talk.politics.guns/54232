Would>those work very well in stopping an attack?Ask the Brits.  Enough people have been killed by rubber bullets that they nowuse them under only certain "controlled" circumstances.  And they are firedfrom something that looks like a tear gas launcher.There are smaller rubber bullets and pellets (for shotguns).  I understand thatthey are only intended to be discouragers, ie. for the snapping but not trulydangerous animal.  In general, they do not seem capable of really stoppingsomeone who wants you or past you.  They are fired at very low muzzle velocity(the .38 ball round is intended for a 400fps load).  Finally, as your motherwarned you, you can put an eye out with that thing.  :-)--Dillon Pyron                      | The opinions expressed are those of theTI/DSEG Lewisville VAX Support    | sender unless otherwise stated.(214)462-3556 (when I'm here)     |(214)492-4656 (when I'm home)     |Texans: Vote NO on Robin Hood.
