This new circuit is the Thevenin equivalent of one that puts out1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligiblyless than 10 ohms.  You may want to monkey with the values a littledepending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio orthe availability of parts.Hows that sound?---Joel KolstadP.S. -- This is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can beaccurate but still cheap.  They have something like 100 megs in series with100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well askeeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.
