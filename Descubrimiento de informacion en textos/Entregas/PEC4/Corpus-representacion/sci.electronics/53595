Because You never get all thermic energy out ofthe powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the restof the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to powerthe turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of thesteam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again bysomething else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (sometype of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically notunobjectionable).
