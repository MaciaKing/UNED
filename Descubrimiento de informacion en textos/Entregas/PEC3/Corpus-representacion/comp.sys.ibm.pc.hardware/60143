Again from my Mac & IBM infosheet {available by FTP on sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in theinfo-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare173.txt}:ExpansionBoth Mac & IBMSCSI: only external device expansion interface common to both Mac and IBM.Allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, Nubus cardexpansion {Mac Plus only}, some monitors, and CD-ROM.  Apple developed somespecifications for SCSI controlers while IBM has no exact controllerspecifications {which results in added incompatibilities on IBM machines}.Main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internalterminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the SCSI port{A SCSI chain is supposed to be terminated ONLY at the begining and at theend.  Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}.SCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer base.  16-bit SCSI-1 requires aSCSI-2 controler chip and can provide only fast SCSI-2 not wide SCSI-2which are both 16-bit interfaces {see SCSI-2}.SCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fullySCSI-1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast SCSI-1 since itneeds a different controller interface in both hardware {which tends to bevery expendsive} and software.  Transfer speeds are 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode is limited to 7 devices andreduced 8-bit or 16-bit {fast only} throughput due to the difference betweenSCSI-1 and wide SCSI-2 ports.IBMHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}:[...]IDE:  Integrated Device Electronicscurrently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sizeddrives. Can have more than one hard drive. Asynchronous Transfer: ~5MB/s max.So at its LOWEST setting SCSI-2 interface in Asynchronous SCSI-1 mode AVERAGESthe through put MAXIMUM of IDE in asynchronous mode.  In full SCSI-2 modeit blows poor IDE out the window, down the street, and into the garbage can.The problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through putrates and THAT is where the bottleneck and cost of SCSI-2 comes from.  NOTthe interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use theSCSI-2 through put.  The cost of SCSI interface is a self fullilingprophisy: few people buy SCSI because it is so expencive for the PC, whichin turn convices makes that mass producing SCSI {which would reduce itscost} is unwarented, and so SCSI is expencive. {That is the effect of theRule of Scale: the more items sold the less EACH item has to bare the bruntthe cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost}SCSI-2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the DRIVE whileIDE itself limits the through put.
