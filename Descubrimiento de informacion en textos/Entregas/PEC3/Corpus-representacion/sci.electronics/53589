Message-ID: <1qmevkINNca5@senator-bedfellow.MIT.EDU>NNTP-Posting-Host: mtl.mit.eduDoes anyone know what causes the ever-growing black border around theedges of my computer screen?  The growth has been gradual so I don'tknow how long it's taken to get this bad.  I have a 19" DEC (?)color monitor, maybe five years old, and the black border is about 1.1inches on the left and right sides, about 1.75 inches on the bottom andnegligible at the top of the screen.  The only controls arebrightness knob, contrast knob, deGauss switch, and power switch.Is there anything to be done, or are the monitor's days numbered?Larry Hsularryhsu@mtl.mit.edu
