Thatfunny thing attached with a quick-release is a gun.  The ones in thetrunk are "better".  (I don't have numbers for Chicago, butPhiladelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons andthousands of rounds as standard issue in the 60s.)>Not that there is anything wrong with a>revolver but if you're a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple>of automatics in his coat (I mean semi-auto handguns) you're going to be at a>disadvantage even with training.What is the nature of this disadvantage?  If the cop can shoot, 6rounds will do the job against a single opponent (especially since thecop has guaranteed backup).  If the "gang member" can shoot, the extrarounds don't help.  The only time this difference can matter is ifneither can shoot, and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead aroundlike that.BTW - most cops carry multiple guns.  You're not supposed to knowabout the second, third, and so on.>I have been at a shooting range where>gang members were "practicing" shooting.How do "we" know that they were gang members and not undercover copsor even law-abiding menacing minorities.  BTW - Why the sneer quotes?They were actually practicing>taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target>and they weren't doing too badly either.Then the extra rounds won't make any difference, so why is it an issue?-andy--
