This is not to say thatpeople in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing likethat when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.>>There isn't necessarily a conflict between practicing with a concealed>weapon for self-defence and practicing to shoot someone.

If you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense youmost likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.Jason - u28037@uicvm.cc.uic.edu
