The debate over the Second Amendment rages on.Arguments continue over what a "well-regulated militia"is and what TRKBA means in practical terms.  However, theONLY authority in this area, is a binding court decisionon the matter.  Even a decision in this area is subject toan overturning by a higher court.  Is there anyone whohas the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a SupremeCourt decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd Amendment?
