A quick query for Powerbook gurus:Tom Spearman, in a post on alternative Powerbook battery optionsmentioned that there exist 3 versions of their Powerbook 140-180batteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (M5545/A), a 2.8 amp hour one,(M5545/B) and a 2.9 amp hour one (M5545/C). Anyone out thereknow how to determine which of these a battery is? I looked at mybattery and there is no obvious exterior indication. I contactedTom Spearman who had gleaned the information from MacUser and hedidn't know either. Anyone out there know the answer?Thanks!Christopher Majkanextug@ac.dal.caBTW, if you can reply via EMail I would be grateful. I don'toften read this newsgroup. I will post a summary of answers.
