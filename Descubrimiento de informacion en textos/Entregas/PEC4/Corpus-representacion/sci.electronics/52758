Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains inany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a referencepower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance whichshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohmsin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an acceptednotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance ofthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omittedreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.So. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notationsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.For power:dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )For amplitudedB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.It has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except forthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notationconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.Common references for audio are:0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms0 dBV = 1 volt0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)0 VU = -10dBV	(consumer gear line level)Often times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned usingthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is alldone to whatever reference is reasonable for the applicationor moment.Note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linearimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, thepower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be donewith the above two identities and ohm's law.----------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)Intergraph Corp.M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.comHuntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) ******** The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)
