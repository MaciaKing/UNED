I ask for a couple of reasons --mainly I want a reasonably compact encoding scheme to write informationon magstripe cards and Code 39 appears to be about right.  (If the 'right'way to do it is something else, and it's reasonably easy, can someone letme know?)I might not get a chance to reply too quickly to this or my earlier post,but I'll get to them within a couple days, I think ..thanx everyone!  <BGB>  lihan@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
