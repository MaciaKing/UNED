Before every instruction some specified registers aremasked, eg. to simulate a stuck-at-1-error in certain bits.Normally, the "crash instance" of A/ROSE notices a crash, sets a flag andstops working. By reading the mentioned flag the Mac can notice a cardcrash. That works fine for almost all crashes, but as said, sometimes thecard doesn't set the flag and disappears from the system.The documentation of A/ROSE does not tell us anything about its behaviorwhen crashing, and so at the moment we are trying to understand by analyzingthe assembler code, and that's both frustrating and lengthy.So, can anyone help?Please only reply via email, as I don't read this group.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------_                   Department of Computer Science IV/ \     |\/|         University of Dortmund, Germany\_/laf  |  |aennig   e-mail: maennig@veronica.informatik.uni-dortmund.de---------------------------------------------------------------------------"In the beginning God created Adam ... ahem! ... atoms.
