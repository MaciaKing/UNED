The DuoDock does not have a CPU of its own.  It is a docking station withports connecting various components, including the portable PowerBookwith its own CPU.  I guess these rumored new Duo Docks have a built-inCPU to perform functions of their own.  Interesting!  If they're notcompatible with the current Duo models, I think you'll be hearing alot more "screwed by Apple" complaints.
