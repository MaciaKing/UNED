Likewise, ifanybody has tried this on a flyback I'd like to hear about it.I would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on powertransformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--somethingI suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in otherwords, you want absorption rather than prevention which would bereal difficult at 15 KHz).----------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)Intergraph Corp.M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.comHuntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) ******** The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)
