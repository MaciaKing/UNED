Nntp-Posting-Host: hengill.rhi.hi.isHello all.I am thinking about buying an external monitor for my SE/30 and waswondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.I am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card thatcan switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  I read anold report on a card from Lapis that could do this, but could not use theexternal monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-back.  Has this perhaps been fixed? Or can any other cards do this (like theMicron Xceed) ?Also which monitor should I buy?  At the moment I am leaning towardsthe Sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)but are there any other good cheap monitors I should know about?  Doesn't themonitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?Please send me e-mail and I'll summarize.I would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail ordercompanys that sell monitors or cards.Thanks in advanceEggert ThorlaciusUniversity of Iceland
