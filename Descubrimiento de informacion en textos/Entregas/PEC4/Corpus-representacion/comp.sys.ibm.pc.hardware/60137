Hello,I have a 486sx25 ISA machine with Pheonix BIOS.  Currently I have8 megabytes of RAM installed via eight 1 MG SIMMS on the motherboard: ie.both banks are full, and there is no space for more SIMMS.  I am thinkingof running OS2 on my machine and Possibly Linux with X windows, and I knowthat more RAM would be helpful.  However with SIMMS, the only solution Ican see is to sell my 8 Megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg SIMMS for about$400 used. Apart from the fact that I can't afford the price right now,the entire process of selling RAM and buying it used probably means thatthe machine might be down for a number of days which I would ratheravoid...So my question is, do the AT RAM boards that plug into a free slot workwell with a 486 ISA machine. I have seen some being sold used for about$90 with 4 Mg with space for another 4Mg's.  If these boards do work, howdo they do it?  Is a device driver needed, or will the BIOS pickup theextra RAM as it does with the SIMMS on the mother board? I know that theISA expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 SIMM memory is 32 bits, soprobably all of this is just wishful thinking... However any help is trulyappreciated.-Ericebosco@us.oracle.com
