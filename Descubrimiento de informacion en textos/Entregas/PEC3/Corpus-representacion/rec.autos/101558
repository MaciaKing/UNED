I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G20.In consumer reports it is ranked high in manycatagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars.Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).A couple of things though:1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving thiscar. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's.2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fullyloaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers matchup). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.I guess my question is: Is this a good deal?Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?Thanks,Carl HoffmanP.S.The other cars that I have test driven and which are in therunning are:Mitsubishi Galant, Honda Accord, and Toyota Camary
