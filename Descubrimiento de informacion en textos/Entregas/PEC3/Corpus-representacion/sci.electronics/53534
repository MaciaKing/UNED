I recently ftp'd Al's Circuit Simulator (ACS) and I'm looking forthe tutorial which is mentioned in the Users Manual (but not found there).I don't have any experience constructing a netlist (such as for SPICE)and I need a little help.The examples which come with ACS aren't explanatory about the translationbetween schematic and netlist. Does anyone have the fabled "Tutorial"or any other reference which could help me in constructing a netlist froma schematic diagram?(I also emailed Al himself but received no response yet. He's probablybusy with his next release.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tim Pillsbury          Internet:  tsp@ccd.harris.comuunet:  uunet!ccd.harris.com!timothy.pillsbury-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
