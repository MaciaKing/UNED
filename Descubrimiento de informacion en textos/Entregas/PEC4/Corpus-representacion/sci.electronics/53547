Message-ID: <1993Apr15.165322.1@novax.llnl.gov>NNTP-Posting-Host: novax.llnl.govI've got two lines coming into my apartment. Two different telephone numbers.When I ordered the second line installed, instead of bringing out another 4wire bundle, the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires. So Ihave one line on red & green and the other on yellow & black.Today I was monitoring the voltage on both lines. I had a voltmeter acrossthe red and green and read back 52 volts. I then lifted up the receiver on mysecond line.(black & yellow wires) The voltage dropped to 31 volts on the firstline. (red & green wires) I repeated this experiment with the secondline(monitoring black & yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on thered and green line.) It also dropped to 31 volts.Why is this ? I thought these were separate lines.Next I went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming infrom the telco cable. I then disconnected all the phones in my apartment andwent back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements. Both lines readopen.I'll appreciate any help on this. Is this considered normal ?Guy UrbinaUrbina@novax.llnl.gov
