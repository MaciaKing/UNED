All you need is 20 amps DC for a few minutes, anda good (wetware) memory (was I using wp or autocad or ...). I thought of thesame idea myself a few days ago. I've got a fairly new car battery that I takealong in my 4x4 when I go camping, and it sits around useless when I'm home.I wish I could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavyduty 5-volt regulator to supply the PC. But I guess you'd need -5v and -12v(and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).An alternative would be to leave a 40 AMP battery charger hooked up to the batteryand run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the powergoes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! andthen I could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)--Harry Langenbacher 818-354-9513 harry%neuron6@jpl-mil.jpl.nasa.govFAX 818-393-4540, Concurrent Processing Devices Group, Jet PropulsionLaboratory, M/S 302-231, 4800 Oak Grove Dr, Pasadena CA 91109 USA
