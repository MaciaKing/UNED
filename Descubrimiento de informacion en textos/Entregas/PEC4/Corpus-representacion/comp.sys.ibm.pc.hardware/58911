News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41Nntp-Posting-Host: ubvmsd.cc.buffalo.eduJust a quick THANKS to the many who explained the backing up of mymasters.  Apparently they are NOT copy-protected; I just used a program thatis unable to handle high-density (old shit).  I was surprised to hear that"NO programs on high-density disks have copy protection," which someoneback there said.  Huh!  Learn something new every day!- Mitch
