The key is Section (2)(c)(2), whichwill effectively open up the Federal court system to all the folkswho can't afford to adopt an Attorney with whom to fight city hall.All of you who've been saying "hey, isn't that illegal?" could justgo hire your own Attorneys on a pay-if-you-win ("contingency fee")basis, and sue the bums ...   :-)What you can do now:(1)  Write your Representative, and ask them to co-sponsor HR 1276.(2)  Write Representative Roscoe Bartlett, the sponsor --Representative Roscoe Bartlett312 Cannon House Office BuildingWashington, D.C. 20515-- to tell him who your own Representative is, and that you'veasked them to join him as a co-sponsor of HR 1276.(3)  Contact Gun Owners of America --Gun Owners of America8001 Forbes PlaceSpringfield, Virginia 22151-- which has committed to lobby on behalf of HR 1276.(4)  For those of us with a RealJob (TM), find out how to reachRepresentative Bartlett's campaign fund (I'm working on it)and toss in a few bucks.  You can bet your bippy that he'sgoing to be one of the HCI "targets" in the next election,which isn't that far away (1994).(5)  Tell your family, friends, gun club, etc.  Enjoy ...   :-)
