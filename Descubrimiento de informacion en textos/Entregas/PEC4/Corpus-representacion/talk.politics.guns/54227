There's one gun design where that can happen, and it issupposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is underthe hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safemanner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if theirtrigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.> The number of people killed in this manner far outweighs the number of> deaths caused by animal attacks or "wacko" attacks combined.The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them Ican safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a largenegative number of people are killed by animals, because we know thatthe number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that thenumber of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of thedescribed circumstance) is near zero.>I can find the figures if you don't believe me.Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking atcontext.  Make sure that your source excludes other types ofaccidents and suicides that are misreported.
