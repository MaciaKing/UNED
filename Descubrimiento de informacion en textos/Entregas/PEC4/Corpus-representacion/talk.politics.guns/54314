Despite opposition to the ban --aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings onthe issue -- the Common Council voted on February 17 to place thereferendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning toreverse public opinion on the controversial issue.An October 1992 poll conducted by the Wisconsin State Journal found57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  Byelection day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted tohave the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaigncommittee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TVadvertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implicationsraised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.Despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the Madisoninitiative's chief proponent, Mayor Paul Soglin, will attempt to havethe Common Council enact an ordinance banning handguns.Downloaded from GUN-TALK (703-719-6406)A service of theNational Rifle AssociationInstitute for Legislative ActionWashington, DC 20036--Larry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com
