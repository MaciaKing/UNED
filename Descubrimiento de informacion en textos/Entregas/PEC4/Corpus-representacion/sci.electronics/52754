Wouldn't a crystal be affected by cold? My gut feeling is that, as a>mechanically resonating device, extreme cold is likely to affect the>compliance (?terminology?) of the quartz, and hence its resonant frequency.Low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 kHz (and THESEhave significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often noticewhile wearing the watch on one's wrist).  Low temperature sensitivityis available in other crystal types, which unfortunatelyare larger and higher frequency (1 MHz or so) and take morebattery power.Programmable timers might be less accurate, but theyare more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.John Whitmore
