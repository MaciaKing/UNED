However, I'd suggest KellyBuchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick forthe All-Star game notwithstanding.As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectationsthis year due to his "breakthrough" year (for him) last year, so he didn'treally raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of thecallups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on thedepth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact onthe team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decentnumbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-leagueoblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilersdumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) oreven Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.--Andrew Scott                    | andrew@idacom.hp.comHP IDACOM Telecom Division      | (403) 462-0666 ext. 253During the Roman Era, 28 was considered old...
