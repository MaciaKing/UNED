It seems most|> >state cops are.Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in thelast two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands thoughI haven't seen any Glock's).With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usualrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my twocents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially alarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages tosemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't standhim and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material isvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or somethinglike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that"different is good".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but inmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also acertain "propriatory nature" of each gun that takes some familiarity tolearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiarwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at leastslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.|>|> Define "armed better".

With a single hand you eitherpull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semiauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.|> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again|>   to rotate to the next round.I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DAsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the sameround - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull willalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dudbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round willnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slideon a misfire takes very little time.|> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the|>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an|>   easy motion, even one handed.Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is notnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough andat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into theround to set it off.|> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines|>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speedloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a twohanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means thatwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears thegun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will alwaystake more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacinga partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine canstill be used if needed later).|>|> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell|>   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often|>   lost as you realize "hey, it's jammed!" before starting to do anything|>   about clearing it.Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clearit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfirewith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-autobut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).|> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round|>   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the|>   chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider|>   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed|>   of employment as a revolver.|> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of|>   operation of many of them requires more training.All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without anysafety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I shouldsay that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it'sno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firingpin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantagecarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speedof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'mnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I wasinitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examiningthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), andshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially ina thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also getsyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.|>|> Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly|> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolverfor safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if allyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock triggerfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed thatnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun andrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blewoff your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.|>|> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun|> the police don't know nothing about firearms.

You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then theshooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the thefire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This isa shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.|>|> What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple|> .38 revolvers that the police often use.
