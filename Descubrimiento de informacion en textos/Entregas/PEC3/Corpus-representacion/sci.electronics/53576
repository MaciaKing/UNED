Hi !!!Is there somebody using a 56001 DSP from Motorola ???I am searching for programms concerning audio effects.I built a 4 channel mixer (4ADC + 1DSP) for audio signals.I built some digital filters and echos, but now i want toinclude some effects like HARMONIC Equalizer or chorus.The problem is, I dont know how these effects work (so I cantwrite a programm).So if someone has programms or just knows how such effects work,please contact me in the newsgroup or via e-mail.(Also if there are books about this problem)Thanks in advance(DWO)
