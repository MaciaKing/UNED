I can tell you that mixing thembetween 'banks' ok, and I can't see why mixing in one bank is not unlessthey are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns SIMMs in onebank ).  The two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  Assuming thatthe SIMMS are 1Mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalentconfiguration.  The 3-chip SIMM uses two 4-bit wide 4Mbit (1M of 4-bitnibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1Mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1Mbyte).  The 9-bit SIMM uses nine 1-bit wide 1Mbit chips.  These are equivalentbecause of the way that it is 'pinned' on the SIMM board.  At the SIMMinterface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1MByte SIMMS ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).

Why you ask?Simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  Assuming you have a 32-bitCPU ( 386DX or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve datafrom memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits whenit asks for data.  To get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboardlinks 4 1Mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so I will ignore that inthis simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  That meansthat a SIMM in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  If youhave a 16-bit bus, two 1Mx9 SIMMs are linked together to get 16-bit widedata, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 SIMMs wide, and 32-bit banksare 4 SIMMs wide.  If your computer required 1Mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide datawith 4 parity bits, used in some PS/2s and ASTs ), you could upgrade byone SIMM at a time.Hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to yourquestion was not simple.
