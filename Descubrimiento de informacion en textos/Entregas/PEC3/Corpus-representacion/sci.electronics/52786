Nntp-Posting-Host: goyt.csc.liv.ac.ukHi,I've just built a valve preamp and use a diode/capacitorvoltage multiplier to step the 12vAC supply voltage up to approx260vDV. As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreasesand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an outputvoltage as possible. (about 260v).The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38vacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that willincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.These capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 ofthem, So:1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallelwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increasethe RC time constant? If it does, and my output voltage becomes morestable by doing this, then I will have killed two birds with one stone...as I am experiencing some 50Hz ripple (and hence amp hum), and this newcapacitor will 'smooth' this out.and2. Can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor (choke) tobe placed in the output line of the power supply to filter outthe 50Hz mains hum. Lowest resistance possible !I've not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is TOO MUCHof a distraction.... (I'm at university and I've got to get mydissertation finished in two weeks !!!!!!!) hence I'm mailing notplaying with my solderoing iron (it'll be cheaper too in the longrun... especially if 14 new large capacitors don't work as planned!)Email please.... Can't always read the net.....Thanks in advance..Chris ;-)+====================================================================+|Name : Mr Chris Smith       |     Twang on that 'ole guitar !       ||Addrs: scst83@uk.ac.liv.csc |                                       ||Uni  : Liverpool University |Quest: To build more and more hardware ||Dgree: Computer Science     |                                       |+====================================================================+"What ever the sun may be, it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas!"-- D.H.
