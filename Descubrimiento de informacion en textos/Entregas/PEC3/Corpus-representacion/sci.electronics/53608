My next project is to come up with an IF/detector module for fast -- 112to 250 kB/sec -- packet radio use.  No fancy modulation scheme, justwide FSK for use at 902 or 1296 MHz.I'm a bit familiar with the Motorola 3362 chip, but I wonder if thereare newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.My goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "backend" with IF input on one end and an FSK demondulator on the other.  I'mparticularly interested in ways to use a higher IF than 10.7 -- do anycurrent chips work up to, say 150MHz with internal downconversion so anormal IF filter can be used?Any suggestions?John--John R.
