As most of you know, we have recently changed our standard VESA local-busvideo card from our own NCR-based card to the new Diamond Stealth 24 VLB cardfor packages 2, 3, and 4 (package #1 still has the NCR "screamer').  We also haveadded the $149 upgrade from the Stealth 24 or NCR to the Diamond Viper to ourproduct list.  Below are the comparisons of the different cards in theconfigurations we will offer:NCR              Stealth 24 VLB        Viper VLB64Ox480 Colors       16,256           16,256,32K,64K,16.7M 16,256,32K,64K,16.7M *8OOx6OO Colors       16,256           16,256,32K,64K        16,256,32K,64K *1024x768 Colors      16,256           16,256                16,2561280x1024 Colors     16               16                    16Video Processor      NCR 77C22E+      S3 86C805             Weitek Power 9000Video RAM            1M               1M                    1MMax RAM addressableby Vid Processor   3M               2M                    2MRAM Type             DRAM             DRAM                  VRAMUser RAM Upgrade?

S3-based cards, since they are downwardcompatible, will have the conflict with 2E8.  Diamond admits conflict willexist with the Stealth 24.  The prelim Viper manual incorrectly lists theS3 port addresses.  No conflict.**   AutoCAD 12 drivers are now currently available for Stealth, SpeedSTAR24X, Stealth 24 VLB, and Viper VLB.  They can only be obtained fromDiamond Tech Support, 408-736-2000 and NOT on any BBS.**   OS/2 2.0 is supported for Standard VGA for all cards.  SVGA driversavailable in the near future.  Windows NT is not released yet, and nodrivers are available currently.  Diamond hopes to have all currentproducts supported in the Win NT release, on the NT disks.***  NCR testing is coming from tests ran in our tech support department wasat ZEOS at 1024x768x256 on Zeos DX2-66. These results are not official.Diamond results are from their own DX2-66, 1024x768 256 colors @ 7OHzrefresh.
