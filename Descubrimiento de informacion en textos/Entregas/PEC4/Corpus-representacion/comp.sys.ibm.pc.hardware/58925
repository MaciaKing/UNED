Nntp-Posting-Host: sdcmvs.mvs.sas.comHi,I have got a Quantum ProDrive 80AT IDE harddisk and wouldlike to format it. When trying to format it (*no* low-levelformat, just FDISK and DOS FORMAT), I somehow messed up theparameters... I had entered FDISK /MBR not exactly knowingwhat this does.The suggested drive type 38 formats the drive only to 21MB.I tried type 25, but this gives only around 70MB and notthe nominal 80MB.Could I use user type 47? However, I don't know the actualparameters (cylinders, heads,...) Could someone give me them?And how does FDISK work together with user type 47?Please reply by email to GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COMThank you,Thomas+-------------------------------------------------------------------+| Thomas Dachsel                                                    || Internet: GERTHD@MVS.SAS.COM                                      || Fidonet:  Thomas_Dachsel@camel.fido.de (2:247/40)                 || Subnet:   dachsel@rnivh.rni.sub.org (UUCP in Germany, now active) || Phone:    +49 6221 4150 (work), +49 6203 12274 (home)             || Fax:      +49 6221 415101                                         || Snail:    SAS Institute GmbH, P.O.Box 105307, D-W-6900 Heidelberg || Tagline:  One bad sector can ruin a whole day...                  |+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
