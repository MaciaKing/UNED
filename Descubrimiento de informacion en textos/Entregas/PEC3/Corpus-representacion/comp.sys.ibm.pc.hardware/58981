These systems still have on-boardvideo and disk which are far better than the prior Value Point systems, andyou get VESA Local Bus for (future?) upgrades.  We are going to buy three ofthem with 17" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three willimmediately be upgraded to UltraStor 34F caching SCSI disk controller andeither the ATI GUP or the Viper graphics board.Do not buy a 486SX sytem.My personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  Whenyou earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. theyget you coming and going).  Translated this means take infrequent but largesteps.  You are far better off short term AND long term if you avoid the SXmodels and go straight to the DX or DX-2 models.Gordon
