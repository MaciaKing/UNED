I consider 5' a reasonable spacelimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard tothose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was atwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it theendangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibilityof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke anddraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamentalflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placingthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assaultrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett hasonly range and acurracy going for it.>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to>protect their homes and families.

I assume that wordwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If thisis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications changequite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martiansintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.

With such lownumbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superiorweapons are going to be of great effect against a numericallysuperior foe.

But, if Joe Bob owns an old Shermantank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow ordersfrom the officers, yes.

The State having controlover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the stateto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such thatthe ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,I would have to assume that State control would rest on theauthority of the Governor and militia officers.>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select>militia should privide the militia's heavy weapons and highly-trained>specialists.

Just as you argued above thatthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic controlso one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where thissituation is alleviated in having the select militia holdingall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue thatthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and theunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard's>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local>governments.

These would be much more useful to infantry than thetank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and>>the like.>>I would much rather see these things handled by the local,>general militias.So would I, but the resources often aren't available tooutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have tocall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff fasterthan anything else.>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry>arm of the regular army.Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I thinkmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and upfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 tontrucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuffof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard unitsin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavyequipment under State control, with little but numbers and lightstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to thestates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the localranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed forother responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have avery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militiasfor these functions.< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu ><  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.
