I'm thinking of splashing out on a new motherboard for my PC. I amrunning Linux as my main OS, with a small DOS partition left for myflatmates' games.My current setup is a 386SX-25 (AMD) with 387SX-25 (ITT - I think) and 9Mbytes of 70ns SIMMS, and (120+100)Mbyte IDE.Basically I have two choices1) Get a 386DX-40 + 387DX-40  or2) Get some sort of 486.Unfortunately I live in the UK where computer prices are far too high.The first option works out at about \pounds 200. 486 m/boards start atthis price for a SX-25.I have a couple of questions.1) How much of an improvement in speed should I notice if I get a386DX+copro. Remember I'm using a 32 bit OS, and alot of Floating Pointoperations.2) How much faster would a 486DX-33 be than the 386DX-40+copro ?Should I get an upgradeable m/board with a 386DX-40 and wait forAMD/Pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 ?Any experiences will be most helpful ...Kenny.PS. Example prices:386DX-40+copro M/board	~$270486DX33	M/board		~$580-----------------------------------------------------------Kenneth MacDonald		E-mail kenny@castle.ed.ac.ukDept. of Geology & GeophysicsUniversity of Edinburgh		Scotland-----------------------------------------------------------
