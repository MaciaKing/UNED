It talksabout how to read all kinds of things (voltage, current, resistance) inBASIC, and even includes code for a simple "oscilloscope" display.It's possible to read the joystick port directly if you don't want touse BASIC.  The detailed information for this is in the PC TechnicalReference under Options and Adapters.  You have to provide somemillisecond resolution timing functions, but that's a subject which hasappeared many times in articles from Dr. Dobb's, Circuit Cellar Ink,etc.  Look for the public domain ztimer package on wuarchive.Good Luck,Dev Palmerdpalmer@mcnc.orgMCNC Room 212P.O.
