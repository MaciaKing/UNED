Nntp-Posting-Host: ama.csc.liv.ac.ukHas anyone had any problems with their Duo Dock not ejecting the Duoproperly?When I first got it, the Duo would come out of the Dock a couple of incheswhen ejected, and I had to pull it the rest of the way. Nowadays (and I'vehad the system for 4 months), the Duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despitethe fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and I have tograb hold of it and pull it out myself. Is there a simple fix for this, ordo I have to return it to my Apple Dealer, where it will languish for weekswhile I have to make do with no colour display, no VRAM, no floppy orSCSI etc.(BTW, it's not that the Duo is locked into the Dock - it just doesn'twant to slide out any more).--Phil Jimmieson,           ***********************************************Computer Science Dept.,   * JANET    : phil@uk.ac.liv.csc               *Liverpool University,     * INTERNET : phil@csc.liv.ac.uk               *PO Box 147                ***********************************************Liverpool  L69  3BX      "I was head over heels in love until I got cramp"(UK) 051-794-3689
