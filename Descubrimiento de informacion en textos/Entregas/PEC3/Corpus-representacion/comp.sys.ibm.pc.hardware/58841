Originator: nshah@acs2.bu.eduI have 1 4Mx9 70ns 36pin SIMM for Sale.  It is in perfect condition.  Itwill not work in my system because it requires 72 pin SIMMS.I would like to get what I paid for it.  $115 + 3 for insured shipping.In addition, if you have a 4MB 70ns 72 pin EISA or PS/2 type SIMM forsale, drop me a line.  Thanks.  Nimesh Shah  nshah@acs.bu.edu
