The trackbal on my PB140 no longer moves in the horizontal direction.  When Icalled the nearest Authorized Apple Service person I was told that it probablyneeded replacing and that would cost me over $150!  Ouch!Can anyone recommend a less expensive way to fix this problem?  One strangesymptom of the problem is that when I take the ball out of the socket and shinea light into the hole I can make the cursor move horizontally by moving thewheel with my finger, it works fine that way but won't work if I turn off thelight.  Any suggestions or comments?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ben Roy .......just a poor college student.......internet<br4416a@american.edu>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
