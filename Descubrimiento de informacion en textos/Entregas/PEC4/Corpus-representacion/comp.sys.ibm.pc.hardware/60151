Message-ID: <1qkb9k$788@vela.acs.oakland.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: vela.acs.oakland.eduI was recently loaned an older Dec 210 286 at work, and I have the optionof adding an additional Western Digital Hard-drive to the machine.  Theexisting drive is currently a Western Digital as well, and is working fine,but I do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slaverelationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.The first drive is currently formatted to Tandy Dos v3.3 but I am eventuallygoing to upgrade both to MS Dos v 5.0The drives themselves are both model number WD95044-A circa 5-07-1991They are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  A note to add is that there is no exactconfiguration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at asetting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).There are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that I presume arefor setting up the master/slave.  Originally, the drive in the machinehad none.  Currently, I was suggested to try the far right (looking at theback) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.When booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  It doesflicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.Hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but notbeing a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, Iwould not even know how to do that.Any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  If not, a numberfor Western Digital might just do as good!swood--Hunting over in Michigan?
