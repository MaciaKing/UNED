Does he have to use newparts when he repairs it or can he substitute used parts without yourknowledge?  Can he charge you for repairs that should be under warrantybut he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part?When it comes to local dealers:- Have fun getting consistently good support.  Most of their "techs" arere-treaded salesmen, not trained technicians, with a high turnover rate.- Have fun getting in-warranty work done quickly and courteously.- Have fun getting out-of-warranty work done cheaply, or even doneperiod, unless you are on a paid service contract.Having been both a service technician, and a service manager, at aComputerLand franchise and another retail computer place, I know whatI'm talking about.I also know the "local service" scam that retail computer dealers liketo push when they're selling.  It's that same old song that car dealershaving been singing for years -- "Buy from me and you'll get goodservice. We always treat our customers right!  Buy from my competitionand you'll be sorry if you need service."Experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail ordercompanies that give excellent service, including overnight replacement parts,on-site calls, etc. There are probably some local dealers that can give yougood service, too. But if you think all local dealers give consistenly goodservice, you are wrong.  I have many anectdotes to prove my point,but I'm sure there are others on the net can do a better job than I can.- Ted Drude (tbdrude@infonode.ingr.com)
