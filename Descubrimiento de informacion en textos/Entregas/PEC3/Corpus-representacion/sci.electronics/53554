Finalassembly _and testing_ are done in East Brunswick.The products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the US;by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like Walter Jung.  Adcomalso tends to prefer American and European components over theirJapanese/Far East equivalents.Off-shore assembly is one reason that Adcom is able to make productsthat perform as well as those from people like Audio Research and VanAlstine (and better than Hafler and Forte'), but at a much lower cost.Of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of Rock, you mightprefer components from Kenwood or Pioneer...Roger Williams		| "Most great discoveries are maderogerw@world.std.com	|  by accident: the larger theconsulting engineer	|  funding, the longer it takes toMiddleborough, Mass.	|  have that accident."
