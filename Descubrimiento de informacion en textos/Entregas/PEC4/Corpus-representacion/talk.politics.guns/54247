PageE7 (in the "Sporting Green" section) has a Trader's advert.  (Thecopy is a bit screwed up - it says that the prices offered expire4-14-93, but the ad is there.)The SF Examiner and Chronicle run the same set of adverts (becausethey have a joint printing/biz agreement and differ only in editorialcontent).I've seen gun ads recently in the merc, which is anti-gun editorially,albeit not from traders, but from its competitors.I don't know about the other papers.Does Traders claim that things are changing?  When?>- Why TV journalists lieBecause it's easier than telling the truth and no one much careseither way.>Let me know if you write to any of these bozos.Before you do, make sure that the bozos are actually doing whatyou're accusing them of.-andy--
