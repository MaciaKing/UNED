In fact it's where I got the idea from, since it wassuch a neat item.  Mattell made it, I believe, modeled after a "spacesaber" or "light sword" or something likewise theme-y.  My addition wasusing a motor for continuous display, and polar effects in addition tocharacter graphics.  I should have protected it when I had the chance.No one to kick but myself...Ten years ago is about right, since I built mine in '84 or '85.
