Thanks!Complete Q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recentcopy of MacWorld or MacUser.  My foggy memory suggests that the most relevantcomparison factors vis-a-vis a IIci are as follows:25 MHz 6804016 Mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slowerthan Q 950 style machines for sure).Ethertalk card on-boardAudio in/out4 MB RAM on motherboard4 SIMM slots2 NuBus slots.More flexible build-in video than the CI.  Uses VRAM.In comparison, a IIci with an accelerator won't give youaudio or ethernet  or the same video options.With a 68040 accelerator, CPU performance can be comparable but Ithink it ends up costing more.Greg Dudek
