I don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such anindex or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentionedand advised by Toynbee. If one ever does you will easily see the magnitudeof the crime of genocide committed by the Armenians, by massacring an alienpopulation under their rule which constituted about 40% of their totalpopulation and they did it only within a time period of a little overtwo years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.Now I would like to ask you:Is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar tothis one?And again I would like to ask you:Whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousandsof Turks of the Republic of Armenia who were exterminated as a "FinalSolution" to Turco-Tartar problems in Armenia is similar or notto the martyrdom of six million Jews in Europe as a final solution toJewish problems?Serdar Argic'We closed the roads and mountain passes thatmight serve as ways of escape for the Turksand then proceeded in the work of extermination.'(Ohanus Appressian - 1919)'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer existsa single Turkish soul.'
