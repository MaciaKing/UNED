They aren't really atthe same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budgetallows, the Land Cruiser?Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performancewhen choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actuallymake enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) theon-road comfort.JohnJohn
