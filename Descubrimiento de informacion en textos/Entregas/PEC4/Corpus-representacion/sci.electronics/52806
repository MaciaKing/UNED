I was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when Icame across a range of Peltier Effect heat pumps intended for coolingcomponents.  For those who have not heard of this effect, you put acurrent through one of these devices, and it pumps heat from one sideto the other.  Reverse the current and you reverse the effect.  Ithink a temperature difference can give you an EMF as well.Anyway, it struck me that you could make a nice cool/hot box forpicnics with one of these, a power regulator, a thermostat and acouple of heat sinks.  The biggest device can shift 60W with anefficiency of 80-90%, which ain't bad (although it would flatten mycar battery in about half an hour).Unfortunately the catalogue didn't list anything more than the basicspecs as a heat pump.  I imagine that you would get a back-EMF as thetemperature gradient across the device increases.  If so, presumablyits power decreases as the back-EMF increases, until eventually wehave a steady state with no current being consumed (assuming noleakage).  If so, then the final temperature difference between thetwo sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more(although that would be a lousy way to control it).What I would like to know is:1: Are the above guesses correct?2: What is the open-circuit thermal resistance of a typical device?(I just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warmtoo fast when I unplug it)3: How does a Peltier Effect heat pump actually work?  It looks likemagic!4: Why don't they use these things in domestic fridges/freezers?Thanks in advance,Paul.Paul Johnson (paj@gec-mrc.co.uk).	    | Tel: +44 245 73331 ext 3245--------------------------------------------+----------------------------------These ideas and others like them can be had | GEC-Marconi Research is notfor $0.02 each from any reputable idealist. | responsible for my opinions
