Seems> Lexus can't stop popping out new models.--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three modelsis the "300", or 3-liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC300 (thecoupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 sharedwith the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the newluxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three lookcompletely different.--Aamir Qazi--Aamir Qaziqazi@csd4.csd.uwm.edu--Why should I care?  I'd rather watch drying paint.
