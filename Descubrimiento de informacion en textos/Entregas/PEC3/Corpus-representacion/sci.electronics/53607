We have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. Wewould like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms betweenfirings. The three that are being fired do not fire in the samedirection.To further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars A,B,C5 ms apart each other. We should normally see an echo on A thatcorresponds to the distance. However, sonar A detects the INIT lineof sonar B! The detection is actually through the transducer of sonar A;we can see a very faint 50Khz signal on the transducer, exactly at thetime the init line of sonar B is activated.We feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.We came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supplyfor sonars B and C.Has anyone else had any problems with these particular units andthis type of experience? Your suggestions for remedies will be greatlyappreciated.--Caglan M.
