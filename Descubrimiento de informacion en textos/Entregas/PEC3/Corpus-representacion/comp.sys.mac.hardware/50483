I have used both my serial ports with a modem and a serial printer,so I cannot use Appletalk.  Is there a Ethernet to Localtalk hardwarethat will let me use the Ethernet port on my Q700 as a Localtalkport.  Until they come out withsatellite dishes that sit on your window & give you internet accessfrom your home, I won't at all be using that port.Saurabh.
