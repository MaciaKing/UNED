(I don't know. Haven't used one in 20 years)Money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties beingsupposed to sign them.  I assume you'd have to show the buy-back peoplean ID, and you'd then have a money order made out to that ID.As far as traceable as a practical matter, I don't know, it woulddepend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name ison the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  I'd saycertainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of whothey gave money orders out to.>Is that even an issue if the weapons aren't checked for being stolen?There might be some questions asked, I suppose, if somebodybrought in a number of weapons each time over a series of "buy back"programs.------------------------------------------------------------------------David Veal Univ. of Tenn.
