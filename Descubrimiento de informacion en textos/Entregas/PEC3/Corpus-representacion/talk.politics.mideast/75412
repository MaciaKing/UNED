Currently, as a non-observant jew/Israeli/American, my own feelingis that Jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in Palestine orIsrael, than the palestinians or Israelis (both arab and jew) do.With regard to Jewish Israelis, they should have the same rightsin Israel as do all other Israelis.|> 2)Why do most of them speak of the west bank as theirs while most of|> the inhabitants are not Jews and do not want to be part of Israel?Who are them?  If by them you mean the non-religious Jews, I thinkyou should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and theirsupporters are religious.  The other part of the problem is, to myknowledge, not that the palestinians don't want to be a part of Israel,as much as they would accept (for the most part) being full citizensof Israel, with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded Israelicitizens.  What they object to is the current limbo in which they findthemselves.--Shai Guday              | Stealth bombers,OS Software Engineer    |Thinking Machines Corp. |	the winged ninjas of the skies.Cambridge, MA           |
