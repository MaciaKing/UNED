I'm posting this for a friend that runs a BBS. I'm not sure if its underDOS or Windows.He is interested in a board that has 16 ports on it. In another post,someone suggeted a DigiBoard, but didn't have too much info on it.Could someone give me information on any boards that they know of withthe before mentioned configuration. Models. Specifications. Prices.Manufacturers.Thanks,Rob--Robert Walker                     walker@cs.umn.eduComputer Science Dept.University of Minnesota
