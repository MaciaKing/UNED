Automatic setups are fine for simple,repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on morecomplex events where you need to understand how the scope isactually measuring/processing the event. For example, is the scopein "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent timebeing a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay tothe trigger event each sweep)? What was the scope's actual samplingrate at the time? How is the data being massaged after capture butbefore display, etc. One common misconception is the speed of the scope.Is the HP scope you're using really a 100 MHz scope? Or is it a 20 MHzsample rate scope (~5 MHz single shot significance) whose frontend including S/H can support 100 MHz waveforms (important forequivalent time sampling)? The 100 MHz input in this case reallyonly helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a singlesample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.So, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to getuseful information from a digital scope. I prefer an analog scope forgeneral use and the digital for events where I need storage forlater analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capabilityof the scope. Now, for the price of true 100 MHz digital scopes tofall...----------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)Intergraph Corp.M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.comHuntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) ******** The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)
