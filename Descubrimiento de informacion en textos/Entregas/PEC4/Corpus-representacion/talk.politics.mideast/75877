That is hard tobelieve for somebody trying to be objective.When it comes to conflicts like our countries having you cannotblame one side only, there always are bad guys on both sides.What were you doing on Anatolia after the WW1 anyway?Do you think it was your right to be there?I am not saying that conflicts started with that. It is onlynot one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering.It is sad that we (both) still are not trying to compromise.I remember the action of the Turkish government by removing thevisa requirement for greeks to come to Turkey. I thought itwas a positive attempt to make the relations better.The Greeks I mentioned who wouldn't talk to me are educatedpeople. They have never met me but they know! I am bad personbecause I am from Turkey. Politics is not my business, and it isnot the business of most of the Turks. When it comes to individualswhy the hatred? So that makes me think that there is some kind ofbrainwashing going on in Greece. After all why would an educated persontreat every person from a nation the same way? can you tell me about yourhistory books and things you learn about Greek-Turkishencounters during your schooling.take it easy!--Tankut Atantankut@iastate.edu"Achtung, baby!"
