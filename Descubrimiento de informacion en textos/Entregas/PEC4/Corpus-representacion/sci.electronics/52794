Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment orcontribution to:In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  Ifyou are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and willnot be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine.The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance ofthe law is no excuse - they will get you too!It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was foran officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Manylaw enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors.Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RFfrom the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was "no way!"But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the policeare writing citations right and left for people using radardetectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he hadfound the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it wasthere.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at ornear the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep mefrom getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when myspeed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radardetector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (whichis what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend toobey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind onlyworks in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwaveenlightment may be necessary.So, the questions are -What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated bya radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detectorantenna?Are any brands "quieter" than others?==============================================================================Randy T.
