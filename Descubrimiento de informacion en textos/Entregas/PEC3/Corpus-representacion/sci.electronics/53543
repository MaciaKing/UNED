Sci.E(E) netters:I am setting out to build and market a small electronic device thatrequires an LCD display.  All of the analog electronics are workingfine, I have ordered a PIC ICE (not vice versa) since the PICs are socheap and low-power, but I am having a devil of a time finding anyLCD displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as I need.  Iam looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about1000-10,000.Mainstream distributors like Almac cannot help me without a partnumber, or when they do look around for something in their linethey find a $15 8-digit LCD.  Even Digikey's cheapest offering is $5 inquantity.I know LCD displays like this must exist because I see wholecalculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys itfor $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  This$2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation,import duties, the case and keyboard, the PC Board, the processorchip, the solar cell --- and the LCD.  The LCD can't cost much.If anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/ordistributors that handle such things I would be much obliged.-Joe Bettsbetts@netcom.comP.S.  I have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices thathave LCDs only to find that the LCDs are unlabelled.  Has anyone elsehad better luck with this strategy?
