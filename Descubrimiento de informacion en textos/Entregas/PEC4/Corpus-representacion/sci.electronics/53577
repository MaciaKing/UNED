The cable tv companieseven tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cabletv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequencyconferences or so). Even today, they use the cheapest possible coax runninginto problems they can't solve anymore. As Bill noted, the only way is to lookfor a solution with the neighbours *BEFORE* calling for the cable tv guys orthe fcc. The chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by farbigger than with these people (especially the first ones).
