I hear that they're called: 'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?: I hope someone can help:-----------------------During the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enoughto melt. When this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the coolingtower where it is sprayed into the air. Contact with the cool outside airwill condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.There it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is thenreformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.Cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. Power companiesare forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires theraw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. This law is now under attackby lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the propertyrather than the edge of the cooling tower. Eliminating this law will savepower companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.John Eaton!hp-vcd!johne
