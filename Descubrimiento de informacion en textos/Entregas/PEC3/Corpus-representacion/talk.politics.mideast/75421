Themagazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germanyand continued publication until the end of 1944.

It is a heap of writing that should bean admonition to world opinion and to all mankind.In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certainpolitical, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. Theyoccupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered"Aryan" and what befell them.Serdar Argic'We closed the roads and mountain passes thatmight serve as ways of escape for the Turksand then proceeded in the work of extermination.'(Ohanus Appressian - 1919)'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer existsa single Turkish soul.'
