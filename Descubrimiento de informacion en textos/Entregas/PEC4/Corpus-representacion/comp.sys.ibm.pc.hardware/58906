MO drives exist already for computers.  They're expensive: and a bit slow, but the disks are cheep (128 mb disks).  Dan.I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the newdigit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how niceit would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation ofhow much data you could store. The author had been talking to someonefrom Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "MDis a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then whenpressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it wasno more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audioplayer prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD systemcan have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick upthe occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!----------------------------------------------------------------------------david shepherd: des@inmos.co.uk                     tel: 0454-616616 x 625inmos ltd, 1000 aztec west, almondsbury, bristol, bs12 4sq"They didn't like the rates, they don't like the poll tax,and they won't like the council tax."   - Nicholas Ridley
