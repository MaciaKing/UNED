For the original XGA you just need something that can do1024x768 at 45/90Hz interlaced (just tell them "8514 compatible" and theyshould get the idea).  For the XGA-2, get what you like.  I prefer multi-syncs like the IBM 6319, the NECs or even a fixed frequency monitor likemy home Viewsonic 6.  I like the Multisyncs because it's easy to run themin modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like1360x1024x16.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Dick Kaul            | My opinions only, not official IBM positions, etc--IBM XGA Development  | they'd make me wear a suit if I were to speak for IBM.Boca Raton, FL       | "Shhhh...
