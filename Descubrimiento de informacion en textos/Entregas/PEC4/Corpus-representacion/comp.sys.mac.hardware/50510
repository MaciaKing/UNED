I recently aquired a Quantum Q250 harddisk. It is a 50 meg 5.25"mechanism. It is SCSI. I have a few questions and a few problems. Firstthere seems to be an extra connector socket on the back that I can'tfigure out what it is for. The address is set by some jumpers on thebottom so I don't think it is for that. Any ideas?Second, it would be nice to get a hardware manual for the drive. There area lot of jumpers on it that we don't know what they are for.Third, I have got the drive to format. It took a while to get things towork and most of it is fine for now. The formating initialy wastroublesome but seems to be ok. The main problem is if you do a reset onthe MacPlus the drive disappears. If I shut the mac off and then back onagian then the drive comes up fine. Any ideas.Please reply to one of the email addresses below.ThanksRichard CrispinDepartment of Psychology    email:rcrispin@watarts.uwaterloo.caUniversity of Waterloo            psych@watserv1.uwaterloo.caWaterloo, Ontario           phone:(519)888-4781  or 885-1211 ext. 4781Canada   N2L 3G1            fax:(519)746-8631
