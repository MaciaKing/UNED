Nntp-Posting-Host: bode.ee.ualberta.caWhat's the latest and greatest way to dim incandescent lamps ?March '93 Circuit Cellar has part one of an article aboutdimming 120VAC lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-control as the best method for controlling brightness.I've always hated phase-control for the RFI, buzzingfilaments and non-linear adjustment range. I hadheard that you can modulate the AC line on a cycle bycycle basis to get better results. To cut the lamp'spower to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of AC, thennothing for another 20 cycles. I wonder if anyone hastried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. Anyadvice is appreciated!Kenemail: sidhu@bode.ee.ualberta.ca
