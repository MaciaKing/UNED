Find another way.You know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straightenthings out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replaceguns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OCseem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.Guns are really "old" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no oneis motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up withsome real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would getus moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuffthat's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.Remember, in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossiblefeats if we are motivated enough and I think "self-defense" is high on ourlist of motivators.
