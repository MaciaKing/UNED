Actually it is a Goldstar, but it's essentially thesame TV and electronics--just a different face plate and name.#1.  Fortunately, TV tubes don't explode.  I'd think the TV mfrs wantto make this possibility remote as possible.  If at all, they'll*implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of theglass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. In anycase, don't kick it around! :-)#2  I fixed the TV after getting a hold of some schematics.  It turnedout to be a blown 2W resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  I guessthe original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat itcreated, burning itself out.  I checked to make sure the flyback wasn'tshorted or anything first!  Oh, luckily, I had a resistor handy lyingaround that had just the right value for what I needed.  I can't see itbeing more than 50 cents!.Well, needless to say, the TV still works today.  So go get a set ofschematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking aroundthe flyback.
