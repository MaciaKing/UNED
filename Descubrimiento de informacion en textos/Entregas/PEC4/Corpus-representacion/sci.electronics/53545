Well, tune in 10.7Mhz or 455Khz.  These numbers soundlike some you have herd before?   Thats right, you guessed it, they arecommon IF numbers.   Every Super-Het receiver has a local oscillator(s)which generates an IF.  This is what your detector detector is detecting (thelocal oscillator).Some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways toreceiver you.  If you want to receiver something at say 10.525Ghz you mustgenerate a local oscillator signal of 10.525Ghz - 10.7Mhz = your local oscfrequency.  This 10.7Mhz IF is then fed into a normal AGC ckt.The detector is keyed uppon the AGC voltage (your mileage may vary).  Sincethe AGC is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...I think you get the picture.
