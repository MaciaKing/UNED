On a typical UPS (well, on ours, anyway),there is NO switchover from AC to DC.  All the protected equipment isALWAYS running from the batteries (via an inverter), with the usualcondition of also having them on charge.  If the power fails, big deal -the computers never see it (until the batteries start to droop, butthere's something like 60 car-sized batteries in that cabinet, so ittakes a while).If you were gonna run the guts on straight DC instead of an inverter,why not do it all the time?  Then there'd be no switchover to screwthings up, and no having to sense the failure fast.  Just keep the DCon charge when the power is on, and it'll be there in zero time whenyou "need" it.Just some ideas.  Can't guarantee what'll work or not, but hope at leastSOME of this helped.
