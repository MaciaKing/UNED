Hmm, wouldn't manditory saftey classes, registration|of both the owner and gun, and manditory liability insurance be nice for|gun owners.As I'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the abovemeasures are required for you *on your own property*.  You do not have tohave a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, andyou do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you ownand operate that vehicle on your own premises.  If you are going to make useof this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texasyou can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinarycivilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or*manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealingall local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the SecondAmendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, goodanywhere in the United States.  Come on, you wanted the analogy.Mike Ruff--- This above all, to thine own      S T R I D E R      mikey@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu-     self be true.  --Polonius     *  * *****    **  *  * **** ***** *** *   *Those who would sacrifice essential *  *   *     *  * *  * *      *    *  **  *liberties for a little temporary *  *   *     **** *  * ****   *    *  * * *safety deserve neither liberty   *  *   *     *  * *  *    *   *    *  *  **nor safety.  --B.
