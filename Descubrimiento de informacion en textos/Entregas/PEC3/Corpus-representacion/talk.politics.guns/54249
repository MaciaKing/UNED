If the constitutiondoesn't give the Feds some power then they have to just shut up aboutit.The only way the Feds should have anything to say is if the Constitutionprohibits localities from infringing on the RKBA.  In which case thisbill should just reiterate that the RKBA is guaranteed by the Constitutionand that the Feds will take appropriate action if it is infringed.---- chris bartz (chrisb@natinst.com)
