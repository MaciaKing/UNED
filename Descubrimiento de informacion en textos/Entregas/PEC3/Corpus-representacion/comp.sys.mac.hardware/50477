Message-ID: <1ps2eiINNc09@hp-col.col.hp.com>NNTP-Posting-Host: hpcsrc13.col.hp.comI have a Radius Precision Color 24x video card for the Mac that fits in aNuBus slot.  The card has 3 Mb of VRAM on it, which means that 24-bit coloris possible on the card!  The card supports just about any monitor scanrate you can think of (I used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but itcan go higher).  You can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with asoftware control panel.This is the ACCELERATED version of the card, which means all QuickDrawcalls are not executed by the CPU but taken over by the video card, freeingup the mac processor for other tasks.The cheapest I could find this card for when I called around last nightwas $1738 at Mac's Place.  I will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  It is justover a year old and never been any problem.  It comes with software and theoriginal manuals.Hurry!Chris Magnusonchrism@col.hp.comHewlett-Packard Company(719) 590-2963
