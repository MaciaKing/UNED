>>SO..  Here's my question.  It seems to me that I'd have the>>same electrical circuit if I hooked the neutral jumper from the>>neutral over to the ground screw on new 'three prong' grounding>>outlets. What's wrong with my reasoning here?>First, go to the local hardware store and pick up a copy of "Wiring>Simplified" by H.L. Richter.  Now if your house is wired with metal>conduit, you don't need a seperate ground wire (assuming the house>is wired correctly and the pipes are connected to a cold water>pipe in your basement).  The outlets that have a neutral hooked to>the ground screw seem wrong.  Anyone else think so?Back in the 70's I was a service technician for a cash register company.The cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they wereVERY susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise.  The biggestproblems came from outlets that were not properly grounded.In almost every place we went to do an installation, we found outletswith the ground connected to the neutral.  For 99.9% of the things youcan plug into one of these, they work fine.  For our cash registers theywere a nightmare -- line noise tended to scramble the memoryperiodically.With modern electronics using switching power supplies this should beless of a problem.  Even the company I used to work for is no longerrecommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for theirequipment.  I imagine if you check MOST household wiring you will findthat the ground and neutral are connected.  Although not ideal, itshould be o.k. for most applications.---. SLMR 2.1 .
