To get emergency medical care, anyone so insuredmust always carry their Blue Cross card. Before entering a hospital,you must notify Blue Cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills.In an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them,you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to doso for medical reasons) the hospital must. Failing to do so within24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. In you needyour card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainlywouldn't know they had to.) Therefore, you are required to carrythe card at all times, or do without emergency medical coverage.Frank CraryCU Boulder
