It has an access of 200ms and a datatransfer rate 300Kb/sec.  It is multisession photo-cd compatible.  It isavailable from educorp for $599, the CD-Technology one, and comes with twomail in coupons for two free CDs.  I'm not sure if the cd's are good, sinceI've only had the drive a little less than a month and had the cd's shippedto my home address in california instead of here in maryland.  TheCD-technology drive has a separate power supply separated from the drive,which supposedly gives it a longer life, and keeps it cleaner with no fan toattract dust.  A Toshiba brand drive is also available, but I think theCD-Technology is better, since you get the same mechanism, and at a slightlylower price with two free CDs.The Apple 300/330i Drive, Sony Mechanism, is around a 300ms access time Ithink, and a data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  I know it is the slowest of thethree mentioned here.  It is not widely available, except through the applecatalog, which is bad at a price of only $599.  It is also multi-session photocd compatible. I think the external model comes with 7 free cds, some ofwhich are pretty good.The NEC drive has been out the longest.  it has an access time of 280ms anda data transfer rate of 300Kb/sec.  it is available from many vendors around$600 dollars, including Educorp.  It wasn't multi-sesssion photo-cd compatiblebefore, but I hear that the current version that is shipping is.  Owners ofthe older drives can get an upgrade.  It does not come with any free cd'sunless you buy it in a bundle.Of the three CD-Rom drives above, i think the best choices would be theApple drive and the CD-technology(toshiba) drive.  The apple drive for it'scompatibility with apple products and the cd-technology(toshiba) for it'sspeed and performance.BTW, the models of the drives are:Apple: AppleCD 300 or AppleCD 300i (internal)CD-Technology:  CD-T3401 (the Toshiba brand name model I'm not sure, but itis also something like with 3401)NEC:  CDR-74I'm very happy with my drive.  And have had no compatibility problemswhatsoever.  If I am wrong about any of the above, do correct me, but I ampretty sure of myself, even when I think I'm not.Also, some of you out there might notice that I have the same last name asthe president of CD-Technology which happens to be in southern california,my hometown.  However, I AM NOT a relative nor do I know the guy.  Liu isjust a common chinese name, especially in southern california, with theenormous chinese community.  Besides, one of my doctors in california hasthree Steve Liu's as patients and another Steve Liu comes to my school andlives in the next dorm.  This is to show that Liu is very common.Steve :-)--Steve Liu                      |I wish for a better .sigdrlovemd@jhunix.hcf.jhu.edu    |Suggestions are very welcome!drlovemd@jhuvms.hcf.jhu.edu    |
