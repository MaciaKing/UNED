Anyone who worries about his own gun should not have one.  If you carryany pistol with a empty chamber and safety the chances of it going offare about zero.  Unless you sit it on top of a lite stove for a coupleof minutes or put it in a fire. :-)--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+| "What doesn't kill us makes us stronger"  Spoken by many A.T. hikers         ||  Kilo Delta Four Zulu Papa Uniform -KD4ZPU 146.82+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
