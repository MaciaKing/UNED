Hi netters!I often have troubles with my PC and would like to fix it by myself.  Isthere any book that show you how to fix your own PC (hardware, monitor,printer problems..etc).  Of course, no book would tell you the exactproblem with your PC, but at least it will give a general idea whatmight be wrong.  Thanks so lot for your help.
