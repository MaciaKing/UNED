Originator: joshc@csaI've got a Racet 5.25" MO Drive with a Ricoh RO-5030E mechanism with thenew ROMs... The thing is, I have a new TOSOH Optical Disk 512/bytes persector cart for the thing that refuses to mount or be formatted... all thecarts that I have for the drive that work are Racet Certified Media512k/sector carts... All I can think of is that this TOSOH cart uses somekind of incompatible low level format... anyone know what software willallow this to be formatted on this drive? or a new DIP setting for themechanism? I've tried just about every combination of drivers and customformatting programs I can find with no luck... any ideas?joshc@csa.bu.edu  (if you have a good idea, please e-mail it to thisaddress if possible, I can't check this newsgroup constantly, thanks)
