Just to complete that thought, the cooling towers cool water thatcirculates through heat exchangers that recondense the turbineexhaust back into feedwater for the heat exchangers that transferenergy from the reactor's cooling circuit.|---------------|   |------turbine, etc---|  |---------||                >   >                    >   >        .reactor            <   <                    <   >        .|                >   >                    >   >        C.
