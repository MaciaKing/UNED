In fact,>depending on where you are putting your new outlet(s), a GFCI may be *required*.You still need to supply a proper ground for a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter!So rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected toa local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.As Jamie said, GFCI devices are required by code in a number of places, mostnotably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  I do suggest the use of GFCI outlets,rather than the breakers.  You will end up with much less headaches.  Noise pickupin long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.GFCI devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check themregularly (using the test button).Running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, Ihave seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double checktheir common sense list.
