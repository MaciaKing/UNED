Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <1pq8h1$7qb@grouper.mkt.csd.harris.com>NNTP-Posting-Host: grouper.mkt.csd.harris.comOne of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 Probe GTon the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to thewindow saying the dealership bought the car back fromthe previous owner because of "Engine noises", but thatthe Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying thosenoises were "normal".  I thought it was worth lookinginto (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned thisto a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror storyabout her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems,ending with engine noises which she said "was somethingwith the heads", that Ford acknowledged the noise, saidthey were working on it, but didn't have a cure as ofyet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- notthe same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuringproblem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extensionwith the Madza 626 and MX-6.Anything to this?  I'd love to consider buying the GT (I'mturning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-)but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud ownerof a Lemon.
