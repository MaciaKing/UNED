Sounds like the picture tube lost vacuum.  This would cause the filamentto ignite and could actually turn the tube from a vacuum to a pressurevessel, followed by an explosion when the neck assembly (mostly likelycracked to begin with) blows off.  During the whole sequence of events,the other circuits may continue functioning, which accounts for notlosing sound.
