The fuse is not the standardtubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is arectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  Itis about 0.2"x0.2"x0.1", with both leads coming out of one of the0.1"x0.1" sides.  I have been told that it was made by MITI, a asiancompany, but I can find no information as to a supplier.  This fuseis rated at 1A, 130C.  Does anyone have a source for this fuse?  Ionly need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even wantto talk to me, let alone, deal with me.Please advise via E-mail.Thanks,Pat-----  I like boats and bicycles, they're healthier than Valium  ---Pat Horne, Network Manager, Shop Supervisor, Hardware GuruCS Dept, University of Texas, Austin, Tx. 78712 USAvoice (512)471-9517, fax (512)471-8885, UUCP:cs.utexas.edu!horne
