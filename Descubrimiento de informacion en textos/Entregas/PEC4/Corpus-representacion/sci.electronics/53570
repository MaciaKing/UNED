The heat is then used toheat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and theresultant steam drives the turbines.The cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into waterto continue the cycleSteve--Steve McKintySun Microsystems ICNC38240 Meylan, Franceemail: smckinty@france.sun.com	   BIX: smckinty
