I'm currently looking at a copy of lastThursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Tradersad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there isa part in the middle which rather prominently says "WANTED: We paycash for assault rifles and pistols.". Granted, I haven't seen today'spaper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it.It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers)anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.By the way, let me put in a plug for Traders. I have shopped allover the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lowerprices. And their selection is amazing.---------------------------------------------------------------------Lee Gaucher                         |   My opinions.gaucher@sam.cchem.berkeley.edu      |   No one else's.---------------------------------------------------------------------
