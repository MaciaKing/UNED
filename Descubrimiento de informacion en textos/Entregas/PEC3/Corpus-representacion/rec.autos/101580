Bottom line:  I did it and it worked.Some 'tips and techniques' are included here:In article <C4zzpn.Ax7@constellation.ecn.uoknor.edu> callison@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu (James P.

Jacking up the frame some more(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a woodenplatform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough toraise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the springfree of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room toundo the pin holding the spring pack together.The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round headon the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.Flipped the bottom spring and then...>>Is this a nightmare waiting to happen, or an easy, though physically>>demanding, thing to do?>>Well, it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 :-)>(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly>difficult.)I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a1911A1 ...A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U boltnuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind oftorque spec ...It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut onwith fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifthand sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack togetherwhile holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let goto get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differentialtilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the righthole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rollingforward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than anhour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift blockwith levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took abreak and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HADbeen lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE musthave ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, moveit back... hmmm...).After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.At least it now sits level..--E.
