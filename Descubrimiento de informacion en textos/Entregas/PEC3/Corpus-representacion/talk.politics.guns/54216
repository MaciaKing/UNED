No matter>how hard you try, public opinion is set against the RKBA.We must be reading different public opinion polls. I agree that themisguided public would like to see assault weapons banned (mainly becausethey are being lied to by the media about the frequency of their usein violent crime ... ~1%), but if public opinion were so dead-setagainst the RKBA you can bet that idiots like Metzenbaum and Schumerwould be seeing their foolish bills getting passed through Congressa LOT easier than they are. And as governments go broke and can nolonger protect their citizens you can bet that the American peoplewill start to really appreciate the usefulness of firearms. Contraryto what you might think, time is probably on OUR side, not YOURS.>This is the end. By the finish of the Clinton administration, your>RKBA will be null and void. Tough titty.Yeah, right. Don't hold your breath. My condolences on the discoveryof uncomfortable resilience in your mammary glands, but this has nothingto do with the issue at hand.... ridiculous tripe deleted ...>The press is against you, the public (the voting public) is against>you, the flow of history is against you ... this is it !Yeah, the liberal press doesn't like us much, but you can't reallyexpect coherent thought from them anyway. Their opinions are basedmore on a desire to appear politically correct than on facts (whichare generously provided by the FBI, if they'd bother to put on theirBirkenstocks and go to the library to read them). Most of my friendsare anti-gun, and without exception NONE of them bases his/her opinionson facts. They would rather believe (despite all evidence to thecontrary) that disarming law-abiding citizens would make the worldmore civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. Theywould rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about howsociety has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. Theysupport spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scumwho have already demonstrated that they have no regard for societyor its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest guncontrol (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little guncontrol (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But theyhave to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confrontthe fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones thatare causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can'taccept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts makingsignificant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directlyhurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a differenttune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.>Surrender your arms. Soon enough, officers will be around to collect>them. Resistance is useless. They will overwhelm you - one at a time.Hmmm. I wasn't expecting company tonight. I might be able to whipup a quick cheese and cracker plate, but they should probably bringtheir own drinks. Do I have time to vacuum the rug?>Too fucking bad.
