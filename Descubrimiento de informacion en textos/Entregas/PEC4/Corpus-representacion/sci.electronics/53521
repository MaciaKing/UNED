Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <LANCER.93Apr15150228@oconnor.WPI.EDU>NNTP-Posting-Host: oconnor.wpi.eduI'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need DirectInput boxes for the keyboards.  These are the little boxes that take aline level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-Z for the runto the mixer.  Sadly they cost like $50 (or more) each and I'm goingto need like 5 or 10 of them!  I looked inside one (belonging toanother band) and it looks like just a transformer.  Does anyone haveany plans for building them?  Perhaps in Anderton's "ElectronicProjects for Musicians" book (which I am having a hell of a timetracking down...)?Thanks a lot!.s.PS: Post or email.
