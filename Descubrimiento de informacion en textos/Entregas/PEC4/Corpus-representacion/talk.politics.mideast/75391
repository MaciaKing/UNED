I donot know why there are israeli voices against negotiations. However,i would guess that is because they refuse giving back a land for those whohave the right for it.As for the Arabian and Palestinean voices that are against thecurrent negotiations and the so-called peace process, theyare not against peace per se, but rather for their well-founded predictionsthat Israel would NOT give an inch of the West bank (and most probably the samefor Golan Heights) back to the Arabs. An 18 months of "negotiations" in Madrid,and Washington proved these predictions. Now many will jump on me saying whyare you blaming israelis for no-result negotiations.I would say why would the Arabs stall the negotiations, what do they have toloose ?Arabs feel that the current "negotiations" is ONLY for legitimizing the currentstatus-quo and for opening the doors of the Arab markets for israeli trade and"oranges". That is simply unacceptable and would be revoked.Just an opinion.Hasan
