Does anyone know who makes a cable or adapter that is wired according toApple's specs that forces the external output on LC's and the Powerbook's160/180 and Duo 230 into a true VGA style output signal? The NEC Adapter doesnot do this since their monitors are multisync they just route the signal intothe correct pinout but do not switch the Macs output into VGA mode.Do I have to make one of these or does someone already have one made-up??The following is the Apple spec for the LC cpu VGA Cable adapter. I'm assumingthat the Powerbooks/Duos will work with the same adapter(?);Macintosh LC to VGAThe Macintosh LC can supply a 640 x 480, VGA timed signal for use with VGAmonitors by using an adapter cable.  The standard Macintosh LC supports VGA to16 colors, and with the optional 512K VRAM SIMM, the VGA monitor is supportedto 256 colors.Note:     The Macintosh LC supplies signals capable of driving TTL levelinputs.  However, some low impedance input VGA monitors do not workwith the Macintosh LC.To connect a Macintosh LC to a VGA monitor, you need to make an adapter cablefrom the Macintosh LC video connector to the VGA monitor.  Following is thepinout description for the adapter cable:Macintosh LC        VGAVideo Connector     Pin     Signal Name---------------     ----    -----------1                   6       Red ground2                   1       Red video signal5                   2       Green video signal6                   7       Green ground9                   3       Blue video signal13                  8       Blue ground15                  13      /HSYNC12                  14      /VSYNC14                  10      HSYNC ground7,10                nc      SENSE1 & SENSE2 tied togetherVGA monitors are identified by shorting pin 7 to pin 10 on the Macintosh LCvideo connector.  The Macintosh LC grounds pin 7 on its video connector, whichresults in pulling down pin 10 and gives the correct monitor ID for a VGAmonitor.***************************************************************************This message was created on MCW BBS a jointly supported byNew Orleans Mac User Group & National Home & School User Groupuser@maccomw.uucp        The views expressed in this posting those of the individual author only.***************************************************************************
