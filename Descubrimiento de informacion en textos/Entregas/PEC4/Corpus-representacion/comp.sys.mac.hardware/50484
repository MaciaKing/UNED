The floppy interface you suggest handles the former, butit doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludgeit. Plus, it's extremely low performance. AND, SCSI has gobs of room forexpansion compared with a floppy (I can just see it, let's stick a 5.25",a 3.5", a tape drive, and a MO drive, all on the floppy interface. Thepossibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous).--Peter da Silva                                            `-_-'Network Management Technologies Incorporated               'U`12808 West Airport Blvd.  Sugar Land, TX  77478  USA+1 713 274 5180                            "Zure otsoa besarkatu al duzu gaur?"
