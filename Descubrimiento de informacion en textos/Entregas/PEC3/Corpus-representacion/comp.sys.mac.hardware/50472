I have got a dot matrix printer that came with a Lisa (I think) I wish to attach it to a PC, but have no manual. I have been told that it is some sort of C.Itoh printer in disguise. Can anyone help with manuals or info about codes to send to select fonts, italics etc. I want to write a printer driver for Protext.Thanks in advanceStuart=========================================================================Stuart Munn		DOD# 0717Heriot-Watt University                  "The sky is BLACK . . .Edinburgh                                therefore GOD, he is a St MirrenScotland, EH14 4AS                       supporter!!!"031 451-3265031 451-3261 FAX                         God may have a Harley . . .E-Mail censwm@UK.AC.HW.CLUST (JANET)     But the Pope rides a Guzzi!=========================================================================
