Yes, I know it's nowhere near Christmas time, but I'm gonna looseNet access in a few days (maybe a week or 2 if I'm lucky), and wantedto post this for interested people to save 'till Xmas.   :-(Note: Bell Labs is a good place IF you have a PhD and a good boss, Ihave neither.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightnessAnother version of a variable brightness Xmas light set:This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!!---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!!120rtn_____________________!modified set for 2 level brightness:string 1120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!\_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!5w    !      string 2     !b   ________________!120v rtn__!___!^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.Only one blinker is used.Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as thestring 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs inparallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistorhere to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for thecurrent shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowingand the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of thestrings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can getone.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as thesedraw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will lightat full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the currentfrom the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placingboth strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at alow brightness, and the other string that was on before to glowat reduced brightness.Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wiresin a safe manner!
