Also how much would one cost?I've had the board for over a year, and it does work with Diskdoubler,but not with Autodoubler, due to a licensing problem with Stac Technologies,the owners of the board's compression technology. (I'm writing thisfrom memory; I've lost the reference. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)Using the board, I've had problems with file icons being lost, but it'shard to say whether it's the board's fault or something else; however,if I decompress the troubled file and recompress it without the board,the icon usually reappears. Because of the above mentioned licensingproblem, the freeware expansion utility DD Expand will not decompressa board-compressed file unless you have the board installed.Since Stac has its own product now, it seems unlikely that the holesin Autodoubler/Diskdoubler related to the board will be fixed.Which is sad, and makes me very reluctant to buy Stac's product sincethey're being so stinky. (But hey, that's competition.)--Stan KerrComputing & Communications Services Office, U of Illinois/UrbanaPhone: 217-333-5217  Email: stankerr@uiuc.edu
