As far asI can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagementbetween Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feelrevise this preliminary draft as necessary:1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniformor out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or femaleIsraeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all butyoung children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence ofIsrael constitutes indication of hostile intent, no furtherprovocation is required.2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatantPalestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineanswithout positive identification as military personnel, clearindication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking forPalestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusivelymilitary armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), orself-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Notethat dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positivemilitary identification and require closer inspection suchas document checks.b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,which is the normal condition) may be assured by not lessthan three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervalsof not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that asingle burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed tooriginate from military personnel, and thus do not justifyarmed response.c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positivemilitary identification of all personnel in the target area ofthe weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need notbe proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraftare attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check thepapers of each crew member so long as none are obviouslycivilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession ofuniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotovcoctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements toland and make the necessary checks, ground forces shouldfirst screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 metersis usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeatedif necessary.--- D.
