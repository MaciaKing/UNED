After all, we know quite a bitabout how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfedby the price demanded by the "bad" part of that 90%....The relevant economic analysis has been made.  The "profit" ofgun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminalsout of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.That analysis ignored some "improvements" in the criminal gunmarket that could make them even cheaper.  (They're not efficientlyused now, but a "loaner" set up would drive the value still higherwithout affecting criminal use.)-andy--
