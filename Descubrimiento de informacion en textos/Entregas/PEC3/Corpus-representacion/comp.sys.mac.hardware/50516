I have a Mac Plus with 4 megs of memory and a 20 megabyte hard drive forsale.  The computer has a new power supply and has recently been overhauled.I also have an Imagewriter 1 printer available, though I do not have a cablefor it.  The hard drive has loaded on it goodies for word processing andother home and student uses.  This system has been babied.  Price isnegotiable.
