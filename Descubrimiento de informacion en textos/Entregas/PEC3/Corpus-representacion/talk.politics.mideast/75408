DEPOSITION of VITALY NIKOLAYEVICH DANIELIAN [1]Born 1972Attended 9th GradeMiddle School No. 17Resident at Building 4/2, Apartment 25Microdistrict No. 3Sumgait [Azerbaijan]Really, people in town didn't know what was happening on February 27. I camehome from school at 12 o'clock, being excused to leave before the last periodin order to go to Baku. When we left, everything in town was fine. Life wasthe same as usual, a few groups of people were discussing things, soccer andother things. Then we got on the Sumgait bus bound for Baku for my firstcousin's birthday, my father, my mother, and I. We spent the day in Baku, andon the 28th, somewhere around 6:00 p.m., we got on the bus for home, figuringthat I'd have enough time to do my homework for the next day.When we were entering town, near the 12-story high-rises, our bus was stoppedby a very large crowd. The crowd demanded that the Armenians get off the bus.The driver says that there are no Armenians on board; then everyone on the busbegins to shout that there are no Armenians on board. The group comes up tothe doors of the bus and has people get out one by one, not checkingpassports, just going by the way people look. We get off the bus, but are nottaken for Armenians.We set out in the direction of home. At first we were going to go into an oldbuilding where we knew there'd be a place to hide, but the whole road waspacked with groups of people, all the way from Block 41 to the 8thMicrodistrict. These groups were emptying people's pockets and checkingpassports. People who didn't have passports with them were beaten as well.Then we decided to go home instead. Near the 12-story high-rises I saw burningcars and a great many people standing around the driveways, yelling. "Death tothe Armenians" was written on the cars.When we came into the courtyard--we live in an L-shaped building--it was stillquiet. We went on upstairs, but didn't turn on any lights. We tried to callBaku to warn our relatives, who were due to arrive on Wednesday, not to come.Then there was a knock at the door. It was our neighbors, who advised us tocome down to stay at their place. We went down to their place, and they led usto the basement. They live on the first floor and have a basement which youenter across the balcony. We sat in the basement while an Armenian woman wasbeaten--she ran away naked. Our neighbors' daughter said that that's right,that's what the Armenians deserve, because in Stepanakert, allegedly, peoplewere being killed, 11 girls from Agdam had been raped. We didn't stay verylong in the basement. We tried to support one another as best we could,looking out the small window with the iron grating. Papa watched and saidthings now and then. He said that there was a fire near Building 5, probably acar on fire. Then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded thatthey be shown the apartments where Armenians lived. The neighbors said thatthere weren't any Armenians here, and the group set out for the other wing ofthe building. They appeared from the 5/2 side of the building, where, I laterfound out, a woman had been murdered. The woman who ran away naked died. YuriAvakian was killed, too.When the crowd left, the neighbors said that it was all over and we could gohome. We went back up to our place and again didn't turn on the light. Westarted to gather up our things in order to leave Sumgait for a while. Wetried to call a relative who lived in Sumgait, but there was no answer. Wedecided she had already left.We sat at home. The phone rang, and the caller asked to speak with myfather. I called him to the phone. It was Jeykhun Mamedov, from my father'swork brigade. He said he was disgusted by what was happening in ourtown. He asked for our address and promised to get a car and help us getout of the city. To be quite honest, Papa didn't want to give him our address,but my mother got on the phone and told him. Some 15 minutes after thecall a crowd ran into our entryway. Bursting into the building, they brokedown the door and came into the apartment . . .They came straight to our apartment, they knew exactly where the Armenianswere. They came into our place. We tried to resist, but there was nothing wecould do. One of them took my parents' passports and began to read them. Heread the surname "Danielian," turned the page, read "Armenian," and that alonewas enough to doom us. He said that we should be moved quickly out into thecourtyard, where they would have done with us. Another, standing next to him,pushed some of the keys on the piano and said "your death has tolled." Theyhad knives and steel truncheons.I had a knife in my hand. Unfortunately, I didn't use it. I just knew that ifI didn't give up the knife things would be much worse. They struck my parentsand said that I should put the knife on the piano. Then, one of them commandedthat we be taken outside. One person was giving orders. When we were takenoutdoors I went in the middle, and my mother was behind me. Someone started topush her so she'd walk faster; I let her go ahead of me, and fell in behindher. When he tried to push me, I hit him, and at that moment they beganbeating my parents; I realized that resistance was completely useless.We are taken out into the courtyard, and the neighbors are standing on theirbalconies to see what will happen next. The crowd surrounds us. At first theystrike me, and I'm knocked out; when I come to, they beat me again . . . Ilose consciousness often . . . I don't see or hear my parents, since I was thefirst one hit and was out cold. When I come to I try to pick them up; they arelying next to me. The crowd is gone, the only people around are watching fromtheir balconies. That's it. I try to pick them up, but can't. My left arm isbroken. I start toward the drive, wanting to tell the neighbors to call anambulance. The bodies of my parents are still warm.We were attacked at around 9 o'clock. I regain consciousness at about 11 andtry to make it up the stairs home . . . When I knock at the neighbors' door,they push me back and tell me to go away. I go up to the third floor, ourneighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance; shesends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment. I often look out thewindow to see if the ambulance has arrived, but I can't see very far as aresult of the blows, and it seems that my parents have already been takenaway. Then I calm down and try to convince myself that they have been takenaway, and everything will be OK.But they were still there. Later, at 8 in the morning as I found out, theambulance picked them up, but they were already dead. If they receivedattention on time, it is possible they would still be alive. Later, around 12o'clock on the 29th, policemen in civilian clothing come to our house withsome "assistants." They call an ambulance, and 20 minutes later it arrives,and I am taken to the Sumgait Emergency Hospital. There they stitch the woundson my head and rebind my arm. At 3 o'clock I and the other Armenians who arein the hospital are sent by ambulance to Baku.In my ward at the Sumgait Hospital there were five people, all of themArmenians. The hospital was nearly overflowing with Armenians. The onlyAzerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events,before the 27th.Then I was in the Semashko Hospital in Baku. I was there 38 days. When I wasreleased, on the 40th day, I found out that my parents were dead. At firstthey told me that they were in Moscow being treated, but later I found outthat they were dead. My father's older brother told me.My father's name was Nikolai Artemovich Danielian. He was born in 1938. Mymother, born in 1937, was Seda Osipovna Danielian. Papa worked at PMK-20, theleader of the roofing brigade; mamma was a compressor operator.They were also beaten on the head. The coroner's report stated that theirheads were smashed open and bled profusely.At the confrontation I met Jeykhun Mamedov, who had called. As it turned outlater, he had been the one who tipped the crowd off. He had calledspecifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact addressand dispatch the group. He knew the phone number, but didn't know the address.Before the events I had never seen him, but had often spoken with him on thephone, when he would ask to speak with my father. I knew him by name. Hedenies that I was the one who answered the phone, saying that my fatheranswered it. He denies that he called from a public phone, saying that hecalled from home, which also isn't true. I heard noise and the sounds ofautomobiles. As I later found out, earlier he had been convicted, but hadnever served any time--he had received a suspended sentence. He was about 20years old. I don't know if he has since confessed or not. I am sure that hewas the one who tipped the crowd off. One-hundred percent sure.My parents were from Karabagh. Father was from the village of Badar, and wastwo years old when his family moved to Baku, where his elder brothers were togo to school. He was a student at the Naval School, but never graduated. Hewent off to work on the virgin lands [one of the gigantic agriculturalprojects instituted under Khrushchev.] When he returned he lived in Baku, andlater moved to Sumgait, helping with the town's construction. Mamma was fromthe village of Dagdagan, also from Karabagh. She worked in Sumgait, first ina bookstore, and later, on a construction site.My sister is older than I. She lives with her husband here in Karabagh. Ialways loved my parents. That was why I went on to 9th grade, because itwas their dream that I would continue my studies. I finished 8th grade andwanted to enter the Baku Nautical School, and after that, the MilitarySchool. But later I changed my mind, or rather, my parents got me to recon-sider, saying that it would be better to finish the 10th grade and then jointhe Naval School. I was planning to be in the Navy almost my whole lifelong--since childhood I had dreamed of being a sailor. My father wanted itmore than anything. He always recollected his youth, telling of the School,and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it.Now I live in Karabagh and never plan to leave here. I will stay at the homeof my grandfather, of my ancestors, till the end of my days.While in the hospital in Baku I learned the fates of many others who hadsuffered as well, like Ishkhan [Trdatov]. He managed to hold them off [attheir residence in Microdistrict 3, Building 6/2, Apartment 6.] for a longtime, lost his father [Gabriel], and by some miracle managed to survive. Ialso learned of Uncle Sasha, from Building 5/2, whose daughter was raped. . . Besides them, Valery--I forgot his last name--was in the hospital too,about a year younger than I, he went to School No. 14. He was riding withhis parents in the car. People were throwing rocks at them, he was hit, andhis parents brought him to the hospital, and he was in our ward. We evencame to be friends. Before that we had just seen each other around town. Butin the hospital we got to know one another better. I learned of the fates ofothers, those who had died, or who were befallen by misfortune . . .Today Suren Harutunian, the First Secretary of the Communist party of Armenia,was shown on television. To be honest I am glad that Armenia agreed torecognize Nagorno Karabagh as part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic.I was repelled, no, revolted, to hear the Baku announcer who read the decisionof the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet Presidium against Karabagh becoming part ofArmenia.After the events in Sumgait and those in Baku, the best solution is to giveKarabagh to Armenia, return it to Armenia, since the people want to livepeacefully with the Azerbaijanis, but everything has to be right before theycan do that.I arrived in Karabagh on April 11. I felt very bad. I had constant headaches.After a while my strength returned. My older sister, Suzanna, took me in. Ithink that justice should prevail; the people are demanding their due.You can't take away what is their due. My parents and I often spoke of NagornoKarabagh, often visited here--spent almost all of my vacations here. We hadeven decided that if Karabagh would be made part of Armenia, we would movehere for sure. We always said that the Armenian people had suffered much, andthat what had been done in 1921--removing Nagorno Karabagh from Armenia--waswrong. Sooner or later, mistakes should be corrected. And in order to correcta mistake, it must not be repeated; and the fate of all Nagorno Karabagh liesin the hands of our government.June 13,1988Stepanakert--David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.
