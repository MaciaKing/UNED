My sister has an MGB.  She has one from the last year they were produced(1978? 1979?).  Its in very good shape.  I've been bugging her for yearsabout selling it.  I've said over and over that she should sell itbefore the car is worthless while she maintains that the car mayactually be increasing in value as a result of its limited availability.Which one of us is right?  Are there MGB affectionados out there who arestill willing to pay $6K to 8K for an old MG?  Are there a lot out in themarket?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mike Brookbank,                 |MKS| 35 King St. North       mike@mks.comDirector, InterOpen Sales,      |MKT| Waterloo, Ontario      (519)884-2251Mortice Kern Systems Inc.       |MKS| Canada, N2J 2W9    fax (519)884-8861
