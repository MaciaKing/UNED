Sender: daemon@cs.utexas.eduMessage-ID: <2051.150.uupcb@yob.sccsi.com>Reply-To: jim.wray@yob.sccsi.com (Jim Wray)NNTP-Posting-Host: cs.utexas.eduArticle in this morning's Houston Post...."negotiators send food torebellious inmates as humanitarian gesture"...speaking about the Ohio prisonriot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards.I know it's not the same "group" but the mindset appears to be common to"those what rule" here lately....they won't give diddley to the BD's in Wacobut they treat criminals as deserving of "humanitarian gestures".This is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy morepriviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abidingcitizens. What is it that makes the criminal so precious to the "leaders ofthe system"?Could it be that the criminal is one of the "tools" the "authorities" areusing to "excuse" some of the rights negation they are trying to foist uponthe law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....don't solve the crimeproblem because then the citizen couldn't be held hostage to "our help".If the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizen/victim at theexpense of the criminal none of the crap such as RICO and gun banning couldbe used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our everymove and thought.---.
