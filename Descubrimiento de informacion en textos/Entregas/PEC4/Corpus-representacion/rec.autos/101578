NNTP-Posting-Host: logos.asd.sgi.comWe're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have thefollowing questions (All we would do is go skiing -- no off-roading):1. With 4WD, do we need the "performance axle" - (limited slip axle).Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tiresare on different terrain.2. Do we need the all-terrain tires (P235/75X15) or will theall-season (P225/70X15) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?Thanks,Tom--===========================================================================Tom Shou			Silicon Graphicsshou@asd.sgi.com		2011 N.
