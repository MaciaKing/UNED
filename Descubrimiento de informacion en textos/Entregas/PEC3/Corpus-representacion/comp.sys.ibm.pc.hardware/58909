Please help if you can with the following strange problem:The Maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time totime, for no obvious reason spin down completely (one cantell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. DOSreacts with an error (Drive D: cannot be accessed orsomething the like). Unfortunately, I cannot just reproducethe error. Sometimes it occurs more often, sometimesless. The last time it happened was when I wanted todemonstrate some software to a colleague.I would like to know if anybody has experienced similarproblems. I don't like to take the thing to the dealeronly to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. Ichecked the other post in this group about Maxtor, andI don't seem to be the only one who has problems. However,no one describes the same problem, and I also have adifferent configuration.Thanx in advance for any e-mailed help.PeterLIST OF EQUIPMENTComputer "Mandax" Mainboard 386-33, 2MBAdaptec 1542 SCSI MasterMaxtor LXT340S SCSI-II Hard DriveNEC CDR-83 CD-ROM Reader (problem remains with CD-ROM removed)ET4000 VGA CardCONFIG.SYSfiles=30device=C:\dos\setver.exedevice=C:\windows\himem.sysdevice=C:\system\aspi4dos.sysdevice=C:\system\aswcdnec.sys /d:neccdDOS=HIGHCOUNTRY=041,,C:\dos\country.sysdevice=C:\dos\display.sys CON=(EGA,,1)AUTOEXE.BATC:\windows\smartdrive.sysPATH=C:\windows;c:\dosSET TEMP=C:\dosMODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE=((437) C:\DOS\EGA.CPI)MODE CON CODEPAGE SELECT=437KEYB SG,,C:\DOS\KEYBOARD.SYSC:\SYSTEM\MSCDEX /D:NECCD /L:d /v--/ Peter Schneider              []  Englisches Seminar         \| E-Mail: pschneid@es.unizh.ch []  Universitaet Zurich        ||  Phone: (41 1) 257 3554      []  Plattenstrasse 47          |\    Fax: (41 1) 262 1204      []  CH-8032 Zurich/Switzerland /
