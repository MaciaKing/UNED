Here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:I bought an 'Infrared detector module' at Radio Shack for $3.95 - it is alittle gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. ThenI hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared LED. The circuit workslike a minature remote control extender in my car - All remote commands arerelayed to the CD player hidden in the glove compartment. It works fine withmy Denon CD player, but when I tried to build the same circuit for a friend'sVCR, it didn't work.The circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with aSony CCD camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my CDplayer...Any advice would be appreciated....Brian---UBSILER @ MSUVX1.MEMST.EDU
