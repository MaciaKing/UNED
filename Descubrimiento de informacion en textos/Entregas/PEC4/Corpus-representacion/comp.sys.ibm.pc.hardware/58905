Hi All,I have heard that somewhere there exist programmable keyboards, eg. onecan program displays on the keys to show some specific characters, et.c.Does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some "non-trivial" datato the KB (as opposed to standard NumLock/... On-Off, typeamatic specs.) frominside the PC software? I have not found any corresponding reference in thespecs for the 8042 PC-KB interface. Anyone have any ideas? (Except that theymay encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above,which wouldn't look too neat, besides, what would one do from an XT?)Great thanks in advance,Andrew.
