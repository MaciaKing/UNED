Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decidedthat there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrantposting.*** file follows ***Hi Folks;As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess itkind of falls on me to keep people updated about theRandy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no otherlegal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and thingsstart today.More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozenWeaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside thecourthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, "Who standstrial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)Weaver?"  On the evening news she said, "I am here protestingbecause I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.I thought we all did."  Nice sound bite (grin)!The news reporter also interviewed some guy named "Tim"who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge theguy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said heexpected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial."Tim" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaverand Harris and the news had footage of a Boise coptelling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't knowthe finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a lawagainst political activity within X feet of a courthouseor something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmedan agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicamFILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors toleave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's caseany.  He said he was confident that, once the evidencecame out, that Weaver would be aquitted.More stuff as it comes available.Drew
