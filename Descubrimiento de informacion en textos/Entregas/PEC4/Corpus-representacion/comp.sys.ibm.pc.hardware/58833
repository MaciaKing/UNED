I was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem I am having withmy Gateway 2000 486-33DX VL-Bus system with ATI Graphics Ultra Pro LB.When I have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything isfine, but whenever I use it in 800x600 (Windows, AutoCAD, GIFs) the screengets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  At the very top and very bottom of the screenthere is about a 3/4" bar of black.  The screen isn't cut off, it just squeezeseverything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  While I canmanually change the V-Size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it justshouldn't happen anyway.  I've called Gateway numerous times and they haven'tbeen able to help me at all.  Two different times they sent me a new card, andboth times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  They even triedto bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple ofdays, when they TOLD me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeksbefore billing my card.  But their customer support is a different story...So, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know whatto do.  Hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so I know I'mnot the only one with this problem.  Thanks in advance.Jude M. Greerjmgree01@starbase.spd.louisville.eduP.S.  I already tried going into the MACH 32 install program and manually set-ting up the card.  Doesn't work.  Whenever I try to increase the vertical sizeof the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.
