I have a 286 with an M205 motherboard.  The Last Byte memory manager (whichI downloaded for a trial) reports the chipset is an AddTech PCCHIP1 chipset,and it is able to activate the ram behind segments A000-FFFF, which can then beused for UMBs (except for video/BIOS).  I would like to write my own driver toactivate the memory.  Does anyone know where I can get programming informationon this chip?Phil
