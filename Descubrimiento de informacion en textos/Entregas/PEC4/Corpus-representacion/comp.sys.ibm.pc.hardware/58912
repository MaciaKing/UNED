I would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept:- Com1 + Com2  (currently on IRQ 4 and 3)- LPT1 (IRQ7)- Bus Mouse (IRQ5)- Sound Card (no idea what to do - can be set to any)-using IRQ2 for Bus MOuse gobbled up too many cycles, and causedloss of communications with floppy disks, and a few otherproblems.I could, I suppose, switch the 2 com devices externally, and disablethe second port on the Super IO card, but I really want tohave them both available.COuld the sound card use IRQ2 without horsing up the works?All replies apppreciated - and I only just subscribed to thisnewsgroup - I assume there is an FAQ somewhere (rather, I'msure someone will tell me about it....)thanksMark Fraser
