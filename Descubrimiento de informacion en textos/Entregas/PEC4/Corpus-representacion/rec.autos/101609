I am fairly sure that placement of the>steering wheel was pretty much arbitrary to the company at that time.....By the 1920s, there was a very active "good roads" movement, which hadits origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked upsteam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so,and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decentroads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestictransport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods werecrucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plentyof good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidlyexpanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of thefirst auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two goodbooks on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco "America on theRoad" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called "The DevilWagon in God's Country" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  orJohn Bell Rae's auto histories.As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the earlyteens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheelon the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on theright, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tillerinstead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though Idon't know why.Dandh3q@andrew.cmu.eduCarnegie Mellon UniversityApplied History"World history strides on from catastrophe to catastrophe, whether wecan comprehend and prove it or not."Oswald Spengler
