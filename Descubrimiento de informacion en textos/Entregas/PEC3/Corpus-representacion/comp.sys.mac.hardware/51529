I dissected it and determined that it isthe microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressedmode.  This tragedy prompts the following questions:1.	Is it easy to find a microswitch that I could solder into theplace of the old switch ?2.	I have old mice (Max+, Mac 512Ke), can they be used with someadapter ?
