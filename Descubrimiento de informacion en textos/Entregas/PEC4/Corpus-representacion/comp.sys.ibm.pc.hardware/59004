Nntp-Posting-Host: hpmpec3c.cup.hp.comX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8.10]First of all, thanks to those of you who responded, both here and via e-mail.The tips didn't pan out, but it was good hearing from you.Now, following up to my earlier post:[...]: Disk controller:  Acculogic sIDE-3 2 hard/2 floppy IDE controller:   Jumpers:  All defaulted (shown as *)::     Normal IRQ*/delayed IRQ     Primary*/secondary floppy address:     Single*/dual speed floppy   Primary*/secondary IDE address:     Precomp = 125ns*/187 ns     IOCHRDY not driven*/IDE drive controls IOCHRDY[...]: Other cards:  (didn't check brand) 2 Serial/1 Parallel adapter: 	      Logitech Bus Mouse adapter: 	      Roland MPU-401-compatible MIDI interface: 		Configured with default IRQ 2, mem address 0330I opened up the box and removed all the "other cards" above.  No help there.Then, not having anything better to try, I changed Normal IRQ to DelayedIRQ on the disk controller (didn't make any difference) and IOCHRDY_not_driven to IDE_drive_controls_IOCHRDY (also had no effect).  So I puteverything back to the way it was and re-installed the cards.I then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller.  Voila!,the PC booted from power up, although it seemed to take several secondsbefore the first access to the hard disk.  Plug the floppy cable backto the controller and the original (non-boot) behavior returns.O.K., with this additional information, does anyone in netland have anywords of wisdom for what's going on and how I should deal with it?-Larry "still (un)plugging away" Byler-
