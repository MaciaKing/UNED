Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <hurh-060493172214@phurh.fnal.gov>NNTP-Posting-Host: phurh.fnal.govHere's a question that may be simple enough to answer, but has stumpedmyself and a few others:What does an external RAM cache card do for you if you already have a largecache set (through control panel) in your SIMMs?EX:  I have a Mac IIci with 20 meg RAM, an external video card (so I don'trob my SIMM's), and the default Apple cache card (I believe this is 32K?).Say I have my cache set at 2 MEG, what good does a measly 32K do me on thecache card?  Could it actually slow things down by dividing the cachebetween the card and the SIMM's?  Or does it still speed things up byproviding a 'secondary staging' area for data normally passed directly intothe SIMM RAM cache?I'm confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory toreally do any good compared to what you can set yourself.  Yet, DaystarFastCache has numbers which show around a 30% performance boost on someoperations.  Are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most SIMMaccesses?Please help, I'm trying to find the optimum memory settings for the IIcisystem described in the EX above.--patrickhurh@fnal.fnal.gov
