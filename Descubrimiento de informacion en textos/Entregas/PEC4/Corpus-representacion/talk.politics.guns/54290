Notwithstanding the militaryestablishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which arecarried as far as the public resources will bear, the governmentsare afraid to trust the people with arms."^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: "The rightof the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  Awell regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a freecountry..."Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization ofthe militia): "Little more can reasonably be aimed at, withrespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, itwill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course ofa year."Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standingarmies): "... if circumstances should at any time oblige thegovernment to form an army of any magnitude that army can never beformidable to the liberties of the people while there is a largebody of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****own rights and those of their fellow-citizens."***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when theysaid "people", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to "the Rightof the Militia"?...  ;-)> Your average> 17-45 year old male does not fall into the definition.You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (andprobably females under current interpretation).> Therefore most> members of The Militia, the one the every gun advocate refers to, are> not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directlyThe Amendment does nor refer to "well organized", it says "wellregulated".

That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And thatwas to insure the People could form a "well regulated Militia", not a"well organized militia".> It could be> argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last> part.  If so, why was it include in the same atomic unit of writtenWhat do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can seth_bar = C = 1...> instead of a separate sentence?Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalistPapers?!James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the "GeneralWelfare" clause): "Nothing is more natural nor common than firstto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by arecital of particulars."But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  Heonly wrote it.> The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with> the security of a free state.

Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, ortheir revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it."Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debateover the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August1789: "What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent theestablishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties ofthe people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in orderto raise an army upon their ruins."So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroyour Liberties and Rights.--Charles Scripter   *   cescript@phy.mtu.eduDept of Physics, Michigan Tech, Houghton, MI 49931-------------------------------------------------------------"...when all government... in little as in great things, shall bedrawn to Washington as the centre of all power, it will renderpowerless the checks provided of one government on another and willbecome as venal and oppressive as the government from which weseparated."
