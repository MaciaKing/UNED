I would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which isoutput from a thermocouple, preferably by a factor of100 or 1000 ---- so that the resulting voltage can be fedmore easily into a personal-computer-based ADC dataacquisition card.Might anyone be able to point me to references to suchcircuits?  I have seen simple amplifier circuits before, butI am not sure how well they work in practice.In this case, I'd like something which will amplify sufficiently"nicely" to be used for thermocouples (say, a few degreesaccuracy or better).Any pointers would be greatly appreciated!
