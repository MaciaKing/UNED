Pol Pot did not kill nearly as manypeople as Hitler but he is most certainly as evil.|>	If so, how does he explain (away) the difference between an intended|>goal of genocide (Cambodia) and a brutal occupation?He fully accepts the differences in the intentions and situations. What heis saying is that the effect in both cases has been mass murder only weonly get to hear about the one that supports the red scare merchants and thebehaviour of our allies is conveniently ignored.A starker comparison is in El Salvador where the allegations that the leftwere repeatedly making throughout the 1980s have been proven with thediscovery of mass graves. There was evidence enough at the time that Duarteand his gang of thugs were mass murderers but Regan and Bush ignored itand gave them arms to repress the opposition. This must be contrasted withthe events in Nica<ragua where no evidence of Sandinista attrocities suchas mass murder of political opponents has come to light since they lostthe democratic elections that they held. Despite this the Nicaraguan regimewas held to justify the funding of a terrorist war fought mainly againstcivillians by the infamous contras.|>	If so, why isn't he in Australia chanting "no blood for oil"?Have you any reason to beleive he isn't?Phill Hallam-Baker
