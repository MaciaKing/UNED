I was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a SIMPLEway to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel).  I need it to acceptLINE inputs (tape deck, CD player, etc.) and output to the same! Soinput impedance should equal output impedance.  Also, since I am drivinga line, I would need 1 volt p-p output.  Final requirement is that Ican either:1. Control it digitallyOR2. Control it easily, or with few resistorsFINALLY - If anyone knows of any FILTER or EQUALIZER chips, that mightbe useful, please let me know. (I have seen a couple of them from NATIONAL,and MAXIM).  Thanks in advance,Martin
