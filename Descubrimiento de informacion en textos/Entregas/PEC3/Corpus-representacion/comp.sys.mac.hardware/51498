I have a chance to buy a used PS/2 Appletalk card to create a network withmy home machines.  However, the guy who has the card tells me there's aDB-9 or DB-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather thanthe 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that I expect.  This sounds more like aThicknet ethernet card.  Should there be a transciever on it, like on theQuadras?  What would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one ofthese cards, keeping in mind that it's Micro-Channel Architecture, whichmeans take your best guess and double it.Email replies would be appreciated, to here or to rrr@ideas.comThanks.[RICHR]--The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the University ofNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Campus Office for InformationTechnology, or the Experimental Bulletin Board Service.internet:  laUNChpad.unc.edu or 152.2.22.80
