(please quote actualtest samples rather than estimates based on theory. Also,don't be limited to semiconductors: consider also insulators,resistors, dielectrics, piezo-electrics, conductors,magnets (metal, ceramic), magnetostrictives, etc).NOTES:to summarize, this thread has so far stated that the only areawhere holes are not detectable is the vacuum. That is, holeparticles only exist in the presence of matter.Previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certainsemi-conductors. The question that naturally arises is ifthe hole currents inside a semi-conductor vanish at the pointwhere the semiconductor is joined to a conductor (say, copper).I don't want a theoretical discussion here about whetherholes could exist inside metal conductors, rather I ask foran experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect suchcurrents *if* they exist.Also note that I have cross-posted this to sci.electronicssince this is now becoming an electronic discussion.Thanx,Eric.----ET   "A Force of Nature"----
