News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41Nntp-Posting-Host: ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.eduI'm looking for a better method to back up files.  Currently using a MaynStream250Q that uses DC 6250 tapes.  I will need to have a capacity of 600 Mb to 1Gbfor future backups.  Only DOS files.I would be VERY appreciative of information about backup devices ormanufacturers of these products.  Flopticals, DAT, tape, anything.If possible, please include price, backup speed, manufacturer (phone #?),and opinions about the quality/reliability.Please E-Mail, I'll send summaries to those interested.Thanx in advance,-Claus Schwinge-SUNYAB Student Finances and Records
