OK, here's something for all of those people who think cops are alwaysmore responsible then the rest of the population.  I found this article in theRocky Mountain Collegian, Colorado State University's newspaper.SUSPENDED POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED IN REVENGE TRIPLE HOMICIDEPROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A police officer afraid he would be fired forallegedly assaulting a teen-ager walked into an auto body shop wher the youthworked, said "You're going to die" and fatally shot him and two others, policesaid.A fourth youth was wounded.  A fifth escaped injury by hiding under a car.The wounded youth ran about two blocks to a house after the shooting at aboutmidnight Tuesday and called police.  He was hospitalized in satisfactorycondition Wednesday.Suspended police officer Robert Sabetta, 23, of Cranston, was arrested atgunpoint over three hours after the shooting at Wilson's Auto Enterprises inFoster, a rural town of about 4,000 people in northwest Rhode Island.Well, this just goes to show that cops are capable of snapping, justlike everyone else.  Now who was it who said only cops should have guns?Doug Holland
