Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarterof what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros onNHL teams have escalated to the following stats:Canadians: 400Americans: 100Europeans: 100Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sickof watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, theRed Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like "Bure" "Konstantinov" and"Borshevshky". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on otherteams is getting worse as well.I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about "Pavel Bure, theRussian Rocket" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I seethe Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not aCanucks fan to begin with ;-).Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is thatI resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (andsome Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIRNORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't evenbetter hockey players. It's all hype. This "European mystique" is sickening,but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continueto have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearlyonly getting worse.I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Buresand Selannes of the world play on their own continent.I just don't want them on mine.--Richard J.
