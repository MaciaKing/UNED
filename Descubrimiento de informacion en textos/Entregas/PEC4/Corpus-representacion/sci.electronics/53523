There also should be a connection of the NEUTRALwire to a ground in the breaker box.  There should be no otherplace in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not inany of the outlet boxes).The NEUTRAL (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' forthe plug, and is NOT safe to touch, while the GROUND (green)wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unlesssome kind of electrical fault has occurred.  It's safeto touch the protective ground, but not to touch thegrounding conductor (because there is current in the groundingconductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same groundpotential as its breaker-box end).John Whitmore
