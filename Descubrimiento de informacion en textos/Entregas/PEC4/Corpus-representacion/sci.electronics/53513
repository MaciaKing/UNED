For awhile, that is.  Then one channel quit entirely.  I opened it up, and theamplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solderjoints attaching it to the PCB.  I soldered them back and it worked fine.I just had to keep the volume a bit lower than I did before.  Probablylousy heat sinking.You said "a nice Alpine" which I'm sure is a few orders of mag higherin quality than the P.O.S. I had.  But the point is - look inside beforeyou scrap it, since you OCCASIONALLY find something you can repair.Maybe even the same thing I found.Good luck!
