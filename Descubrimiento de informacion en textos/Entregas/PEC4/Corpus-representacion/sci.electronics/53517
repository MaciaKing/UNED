Message-ID: <1qk9qoINNdfl@controversy.math.lsa.umich.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: sirius.math.lsa.umich.edu1. Can low Voltage lights be controlled with an X10  module by putting itbefore the transformer? It seems to work, even the dimmer works. Not veryreliable. Will it damage the module? Can it be done reliably?2. I put a motion switch (Heath) to a low voltage light, it worked but now it isbroken, too much current? How can I get arround that?3. How can I increase the intensity of a light using the X10 PC computerinterface without having it go 100% on first and then down. I am doingmy own programing, not the X10 program.Thanks   C. Montenegro
