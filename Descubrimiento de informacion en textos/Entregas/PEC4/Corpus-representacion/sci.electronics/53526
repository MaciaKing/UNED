I had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 Lincoln Contenintal) whichis a digital dash. They replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash (thank god itwas under the warrenty ! :-) Anyway, the odometer was reading the exact milagefrom the old panel. It must have a EEPROM of some sort in it that is up-dated.Seems to me that removing the battery would erase it, but it doesn't. So Iguess they swapped the NVM chip (non-volitile memory) and installed it in thenew dash. No, they wouldn't let me have the old dash to tinker with :-(-=-= Wes =-=-
