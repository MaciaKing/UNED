I have a new scope and I thought I'd save a few bucks bybuying one with a function generator built in. After having it awhileI noticed two things about the function generator. For one, thereseems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. That is,I have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans somerandom 50mV bias.The other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn outputwon't go below about 1V p-p. I am a student ( you may have guessedfrom my previous posts ), and I often have to measure the inputimpedances of various circuits I build.Many of the circuits havemaximum input signals of way less than 500mV amplitude and most haveinput impedances in the 10's of Kohm range. The thing is, in order touse my function generator I have to divide the voltage to some thingreasonable. Then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of mycircuit I am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.With the 50ohm output of the generator I could just ignore it, but nowwith this little divider there I have to figure that in. It's kind ofa pain in  the ass.Is there any way I could make myself a little box that couldsolve this little problem. The box would tkae the function generatorinput, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is somelow, unchanging number. I would want to lower the voltage by a factorof one hundred or so. I could just build a little buffer amp, but I'dlike to have this box not be active.Any quick ideas. The scope's not broken. For other reasons Ihad sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. Thefunction generator was the same way on that one, too.please help as I am feeling very stupidtoday,davedgj2y@virginia.edu
