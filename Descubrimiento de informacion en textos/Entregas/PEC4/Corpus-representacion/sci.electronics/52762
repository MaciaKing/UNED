I want to convert a 500 Volt sinewave with frequency between 1 kHzand 10 kHz, to a 10 Volt sinewave with the same frequency, bymeans of a transformer. The secondary current will be .6 A (600 mA).What kind of transformer should I use (ferrite?)Can I buy one? If so, I need a partnumber and supplierIf I cannot buy one, how do I go about winding one myself?What core do I use, how big must it be in order not to saturate,what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.?I know little about analog electronics, so I hope some kindsoul here will help me out.Pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated.Thanks,Mark de Rooirooi@tpd.tno.nl
