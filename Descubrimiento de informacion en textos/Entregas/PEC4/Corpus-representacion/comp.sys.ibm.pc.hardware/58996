H E L P !I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...Some background about my PC:- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM- config.sys file:device=c:\dos\himem.sysdos=high,umbdevice=c:\windows\emm386.exe noemsfiles=30buffers=30stack=9,256- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in placefor windows.Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktopfor Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I alsoallow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is runningand right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)from the desktop.First of all, I always get the application error screen followed byanother application error screen with various different messages. Thefollowing are some of them:- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is somenumber. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same addressSome how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address0001:XXXX means?I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out theTSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not tellingWIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossingmemory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to tryanything.--------------Steve ChuAT&T Bell LabsHolmdel, NJ
