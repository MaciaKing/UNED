These lines accummulate as the operation is continued.  If awindow is moved over the involved area of the screen and then moved awaythe line disappear from that area of the screen.  This problem is notobserved if the monitor is configured for 16 colors or a 14 inch Applemonitor with 256 colors is used.I suspect a bad video RAM chip but cannot be certain.  The problem hasbeen apparent since day 1 but has gotten worse.We were wondering if anyone has seen anything like this, and if so, howto fix it.  Please also respond to azelenet@bigmac.mskcc.org.
