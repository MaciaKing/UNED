As Iunderstand it, DX50's can have local bus devices (on the mother-board?)but not local bus slots.  And according to what I been told, manysystems go beyond the VESA local bus standard in order to provide DX50systems with a local bus slot capability.  I have definitly seen amother board with 2 local bus slots which claimed to be able tosupport any CPU, including the DX2/66 and DX50.  Can someone throwsome more informed light on this issue?You will need to check with peripheral makers to see if their boardswill work at 50 MHz.  Some will with some motherboards.- Tonycatone@compstat.wharton.upenn.edu
