Likewisefor the San Francisco Chronicle, and I have never seen a gunad in the San Francisco Examiner.Specifically, about a year ago on Thursdays, when Traders placedits ads, the Chron. ad would not have any graphics representingany handgun sale, though text could list it.  The Trib. wouldrun a graphic of a handgun.  The Examiner would not have a Tradersad at all.Over the past year while Oakland politicians have made a lot of noiseabout measures to fight crime the Trib stopped taking the Tradersad, then started publishing it, but without any handgun graphic, thenstopped, then started.  Since the Trib. was sold some months ago ithas not had the Traders ad.  During one of these non-ad interludesa Traders employee told me that the Trib. had refused to take theirads.Yes, the usual Chron. Thursday ad was there today, with graphicsrepresenting rifles, safes, etc. as usual.Joan V
