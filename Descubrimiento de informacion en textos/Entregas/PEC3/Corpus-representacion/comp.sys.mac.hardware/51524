Nntp-Posting-Host: eniac.seas.upenn.eduI too am interested in peoples' experience with accelerators for theSE.  Is an accelerator the best route to improve performace in my SE, or shouldI consider upgrading to an SE/30 motherboard?  Obviously, buying a new macwould be ideal, but alas, I only have enough money for an accelerator ormotherboard.E-mail reply preferred.  Thanks.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Steve LabovitzDept. of Materials Science & EngineeringU. Penn
