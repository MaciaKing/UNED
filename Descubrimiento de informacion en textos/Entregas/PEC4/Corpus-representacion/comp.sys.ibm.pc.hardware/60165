I am doing a report on the topic of 'Advanced Memory Management' andneed to know of some good references to cover this topic.  It is anAnalytical Chemistry class on Instrumental Analysis.  So, as youcould guess, it doesn't have to be an extremely thorough or extensivecovering of the topic.  Also, I am a Chemical Engineer and know some,but not too much about memory management.  If anyone could help pointme in a good direction I would be very thankful.Thanks in advance.Joe Bleazard      gt5576b@hydra.gatech.eduSchool of Chemical EngineeringGeorgia Institute of TechnologyAtlanta, GA  30332-0100
