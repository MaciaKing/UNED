I would like to know what people's opinions are about the"real world" differences are between a C650 with and withouta coprocessor...I don't use anything like Mathamatica, Maple, etc. I don't useSpreadsheets (at least no sheets with complicated anything), Idon't use 3D CAD apps (although I used to),I DO:  use 3D renderers, EXTENSIVE communications, I run a BBS,I write software, I write papers, etc...BTW, just for kicks, this is what I was told by my local AppleRep about upgrading a 68LC040 to a 69RC040 on a C650:"Well, Apple built in an extra socket for the coprocessor chip.That way, you just plug in the coprocessor, and it works."I then heartily laughed and hung up the phone.thanks,-nateo---------------------------+======================================o| "I hate quotations.       |     This message brought you by      ||   Tell me what you know." |   Nate Sammons, and the number 42.   ||    --Ralph Waldo Emerson  |  ns111310@longs.lance.colostate.edu  |o---------------------------+======================================o
