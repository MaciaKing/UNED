In fact, it is oftenchosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver doesbasically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to thefact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence lesstraining time required.Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact tahtthey do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) whichif properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gunfrom the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe andwould not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in variousgun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a littletest where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and askedpeople with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun andshoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver timeswere pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, orthe person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light triggerwhich can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuingcity,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, butsuch training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  Iknow if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the offchance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough timeto draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocksin my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU theoperator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note Idon't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.-Just my $.02 + tax-------   Steve Syck        syck5280@miller.cs.uwm.edu        --------
