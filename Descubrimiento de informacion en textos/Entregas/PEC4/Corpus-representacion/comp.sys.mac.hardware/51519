Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <1qke0s$61e@agate.berkeley.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: plasma2.ssl.berkeley.eduExcuse me if this is a frequent question, I checked inseveral FAQs but couldn't really find anything.I have a IIsi with the standard 5 meg memory and I want(need) to add additional memory.  But I'm on a budget.I really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what isthe best (performance wise) and most economical wayto do this?  Someone told me that I should only useSIMMs of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,4 2 meg, etc.  What if I just wanted to buy just 1 4 megand use the rest of what I already have?  The manualhasn't been very helpful with this.Thanks.(Respond via e-mail if it isn't worth the bandwidth.)____________________________________________________________________"common human laws and interests     "I wouldn't exactly call it aand emotions have no validity        a happy dogma, but it makes meor signifigance in the vast          feel better about notcosmos-at-large..."                  getting laid..."-HP Lovecraft                 -R.
