Even if the FBI had done nothing, I guess theBDs would have committed suicide, but maybe not until hunger and thirst gave themthe choice between sucide or surrender.The BDs was warned in beforehand about the FBI action. They HAD the chance tosurrender and get a fair trial. No matter who started the fire, the BDs wereresponsible for 80+ peole dying. No one else.--============================================================================Paal Ellingsen       | Borgensvingen 67/102 | Tlf.: 083 50933paale@stud.cs.uit.no | 9100 Kvaloeysletta   | DATA = Dobbelt Arbeid Til Alle============================================================================
