My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and Ithink its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subarudealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealertold us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary todisassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Torontobut found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there anySVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story istrue, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the carlooks great.SWD Wan.
