I have an Adcom GFA-555 that I got in 1985.  There certainly isn'tanything magic about it.  The components used are decent, butnothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components.The GFA-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  I'm glad that Adcom hadthe guts to not over-do the packaging.  It irks me when I seeaudiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probablycost much more and receive more attention than the electronics theyare supposed to serve.I don't see any big deal about the geographic region in whichsomething is assembled.  This is especially true for something aslow-technology as a GFA-555.I'd hope that a GFA-545 would still work well after several years.Except under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there togo wrong.--Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED
