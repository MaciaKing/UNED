This is from Sams'"Reference Data for Engineers," seventh edition, Pg 5-30, which claimsin turn to be from MIL-STD-275C...width   Temp riseinches  degrees C------  ---------.125	100.15	 75.17	 60.20	 45.24	 30.33	 20At 10 amps, the rise for the .125 width is only about 30 degrees.Power goes as square of the current, plus the copper resistance goesup as temperature goes up...  Certainly .20" (~5mm) traces should beample for what you want to do.  And 2 ounce copper almost cuts therequired width in half.  (I'd do 2 oz at about 0.08" width myself,I think...given that the _rated_ current is 10 amps and the 15 isa transient or fault condition.)(There's another question: will the voltage drop be low enough?But you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables orjust the resistivity of copper.  Keep traces short and use separatesensing traces where appropriate, as mentioned by another poster.)
