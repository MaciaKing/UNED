[1]Born 1964Secretary-TypistAzsantekmontazh TrustSumgait Construction and Installation AdministrationSecretary of the SMU Komsomol OrganizationResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15Microdistrict No. 3Sumgait [Azerbaijan]On the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o'clock show,at the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yardsaway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, "The Abyss."Before the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium atthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there's no conversationwhatsoever, and we couldn't figure out what was going on. That is, we knew itwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, ifsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn't know. We bought our tickets. Therewere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for thatlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped thefilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Wellmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that anArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said thatthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could doto Armenian girls. I thought that's what they meant because they had demandeda girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to moveover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someonerecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina.It got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it'sonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats.Everyone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis,people of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in theauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, andgradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, "OK, we'vescared them enough, let's leave." They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed tome that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of"anasha", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, likethey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothinghad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerfulfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. Wecould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine,and it was dark . . .Marina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that's the center of town. LeninStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting,something about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren't especiallylistening, because the way we were feeling we didn't know if we were going tomake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportationwasn't running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police,policemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at thedoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doorsthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-stricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like somenaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well,since he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that superserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, welive literally one stop away. We didn't want to go on foot, not because it wasdark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but thedriver didn't want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, andhe said he'd take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well,OK . . .So we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible washappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportationwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting "Ka-ra-bagh," they're not goingto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what's going on, and there'simmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end hadcome, they were going to come, kill us, that's it . . . Somehow we managed tocheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,just what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mammadown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as thoughnothing had happened.That was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn't go anywhere anddidn't call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.That day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn'tguess.On the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we alwayshad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda,Marina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home andno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started thatmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting athome and didn't know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, LyudaZimogliad, came by at around three o'clock I think. We worked together, we didour apprenticeships together, she's a Russian girl. She said that somethingawful was happening in town. I asked, "Don't they want Armenians? Well whatare they after, if they're already in that state?" She says, no, nothing likethat, it's just a demonstration, but it's awful to watch it. Somehow, it feelslike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . Thecabs, the buses, well it's just a nightmare.Then Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergyproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,asked him, "Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things goingon in the courtyard; aren't you afraid to go out?" Papa didn't know what shewas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came homeand told Mamma. Mamma said, "Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it meansthat something is really going on." But we didn't go see her, she's a Russian,she lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o'clock Itell Lyuda, "Ok, look, it's time for you to go, it's late already, I'll seeyou out." Mamma says, "You don't need to go, it's too late already, you cansee what the situation in town is." So we decided to stay home. Dinner wasready. Mamma says, "Let her eat with us, then she can go." We sat down at thetable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everythingout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we're eating.We turned on the television, and the show "In Fairy-Tale Land" was coming on.We cleared the table.We hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can'tsee what's going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the busstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people. . . I can't figure out what's happening. They're shouting something, lookingsomewhere, I can't make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she'san Azerbaijani; we've been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go downto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-storybuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20people, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even seeseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decidethat means it's not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they're notkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One ofthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with theirfeet, everyone's kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain ingeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can't speak. . . Well, they've probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .If each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from himand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn't see if hegot up and left or not.I become terrified and go home and say, "Lyuda, don't go anywhere, stay at ourplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . " Then the crowdruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building andstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighborsare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob isshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As itturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down andkept them from coming in. There's only one entryway there, they could stopthem.They all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,afraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break thewindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard,and it's packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don'tcrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It's just a hugecloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian SergeySargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately heartramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendousdin and roar. It's incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they wereshouting Father's name, "Grisha, open the door, we've come to kill you!," orsomething like that. I don't remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mammasays, "Into the bedroom, quickly!" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, partof our dowry; Mamma says, "Hide there, they probably won't come in there,they'll ask something, say something, and leave." She says, "We'll tell themthat we live alone here." I can't imagine that my parents will stand out inthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and saythat I'll stand together with them, I'll talk with them if they come, maybe Ican find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speakAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina andLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can't remember if I toldher anything or not.Then . . . they open the door: it's like they blew on it and it broke and fellright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,leave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. Itell them, "What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, whathas happened." In Azerbaijani, they say, "Get out of the apartment, leave." Isay, "OK. Go downstairs. We'll gather everything we need and leave theapartment." I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights withthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in thedoorway, the young guys, say, "There are old people and one girl with them.Too bad!" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I havepacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts,commanding them: "Don't you understand what you are saying? Kill them?"And that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into oneroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and startundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there,in front of Mamma. I don't remember where they went, what they did, or howmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,and tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don't even know what I said. Theatrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued amongthemselves who would go first.Later, I remember, I came to. I don't know if I'm dead or alive. Someone comesin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding.He looks around at what's happening. At that instant everything stops. Itseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everythingdepends on him. He looks and says, "Well, we're done here." They are beatingMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she's dead. Papa . . . wasout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can't get thewindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and thewindows can't be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinkingabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She's not a real strongperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I'm saying something, thatI'm still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be,which is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . theydon't get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I'm dead, why would Ihumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that's what I think, since mytongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.I no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don'tknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me bymy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings,something metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someoneelse is pinching me . . .I don't even know. I think, my God, when will deathcome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me nearthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . Whathappened after that, how many people there were, I don't remember.I come to after a while, I don't remember how long. A neighbor is bringing meclothing. I'm entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I rememberthat I said the same words over and over again: "Mamma, what happened, Mamma,what have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?" I can't makesense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, heserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they allwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered hiscourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors', even thoughhe's small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; heserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also servedthere, I think; now he's stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igorbrought me to the neighbors', and then helped me come to my senses, saying,"Karina, I know you, calm down, I'm not one of them." How do I know who's whoand what's what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. ThenPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there whenthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyudasaid that she was Russian, they said, we'll let you go, we aren't touching theRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she's goingto tell them she's Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina's and Lyuda'shands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is oursister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor's and starts poundingon the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them inthere. So they survived.My sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.While they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming backup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayedthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and putit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor's on the fourth floor, theone whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, andknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, "I'm not going to let youin the apartment because I'm afraid of them. But I'll give you some stockingsand we'll leave the building." Lyuda says, "I'll stay at your place because ofwhat's going on, they keep going up and down the stairs." It was just for amoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn't consent. Lyuda cameback to our place and lay under the bed . . .I came to. Mother was there. I can't remember my supervisor's telephonenumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and hecame to get us. He didn't have any idea what was going on. He thought we weresimply afraid, he didn't know that they were killing us and that we had passedbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.There they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly,it was hard to breathe . . .My supervisor's name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He's the head of ouradministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great numberof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinarypassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, rightafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save agreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, andwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, notonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next,without stopping. After us.I think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were fromBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman diedfrom Building 16, that's the building in front of ours. There youngAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn't let it into their building.Incidentally, when we were at the neighbors', Marina called our relativesto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt inMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, "Runquickly, I can't explain what's going on; hide, do what you can, just stayalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis', ones who won't give you away." At that momentthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in suchawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up,there was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anythingout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my facewas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get mynormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started toscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants youhere, haven't you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One ofthe soldiers said, "Don't scream at us. We're Muslims, but we're not from theSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan." So at that point theDaghestan police were there.When we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,there were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don't know,maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriouslyinjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don't know what theywere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyudaand me and said, "These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don'tknow what to do with the rest."So they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. Myboss said, "Don't worry, I'll find you, no matter where you are, no matterwhat happens." We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a departmenthead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. Sheexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgaitambulances hadn't done anything, they didn't respond to any calls. Peoplecalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.That doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that somethingvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself,"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?" She looks me over andsays, "Now why are you suffering so? You don't know what your people have beendoing, your people did even worse things." And I think, great, I have to dealwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don't I just die so as not tohave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in thiscondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn'thave the energy to say, "How could our people possibly be smart enough tothink of something that yours haven't already done?" I stayed there. Then theybrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in herown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The nextmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn't do anything to help us. Thiswas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn't do anythingmore than examine me, that was it. I didn't want any shots or tranquilizer,nothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn't even want to look atthem.I lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-pose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. Thatsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my facewas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, "Better to askyour brother what happened, there's no point in asking me, your brother canbetter explain what happened." She fell into a faint. All the doctors threwthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into myward.Then people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought meclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress,but the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way upabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, "I can't believe you put on such ashort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?" I went back to myward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came andbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but Icouldn't take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I saidthat I couldn't take the apples, and really didn't have any appetite. No onehad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . .Then I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history shouldbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was anArmenian, maybe they wouldn't figure it out from looking at me. So they musthave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that somethingelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside onthe street, I don't know. In any case, I didn't sleep a wink that night.The next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus,and off we went. I didn't even know where they were taking me. They took me tothe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.I got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great manytroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I sawa few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thoughtthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgaitafter that night. I still didn't know what happened to my parents, they didn'tcome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine.I didn't know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calmme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and sawa lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing eachother and asking, "What happened, what went on?" Two days later they came tosee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showedinterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything theycould. Of course I'm most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagueswho didn't lose his presence of mind and who didn't change his opinions,neither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter whathappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came,not from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is partof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangementswith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down bymyself I couldn't get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with mylungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there Ilay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just befrom all the blows, I don't know. They didn't diagnose anything in particular.When I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point ofinsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful.There was no way something inside wasn't broken, my ribs . . . Well they tookme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There wereemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina'sfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children's Clinic.They had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what Ineeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficultybreathing, I couldn't seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.They put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard somepeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being allbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But Iwasn't cut.They took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soonappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would nottalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, "Wedemand that Seidov come!" The response was, "It's Seidov who sent us." Seidovis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said,"We'll only see Seidov's daughter, have her come here, we'll do the samethings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we'll deal with youagitators." And so on. More of them said, "Have Seidov himself come." Thiswent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove usout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan becausethey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: Thesmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children whohad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in aclub that didn't even have running water all the time? At first we had to payto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second daysomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.Everything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movietheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn't sit or lie down, itwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infantstook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill inYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not tomention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were faintingright and left. I just don't know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Onlythe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the womenwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would comeany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gatheredtogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movietheater and there wouldn't be a single Armenian left. Then people went up tothe attic. I didn't see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down andcouldn't get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparentlythey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn thetheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn't. I was in no condition to open myeyes.Everyone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, "Aren't you anAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you're an Azerbaijani." Theyled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking theirpassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people didnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes innothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not likethey should have, with their IDs.So on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. OnMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn'tspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,they burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murderedthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-in-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Onlythe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself,she ran away, the neighbors wouldn't take her in, so she ran about thebuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children.This all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops werealready in the city.They murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entirefamilies. They say they didn't even know for sure if the people were Armeniansor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I'm not sure myself, I didn'tsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it's very difficultnow to say exactly who died and who didn't. It was very difficult to identifythe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused ingasoline and burned . . . it's all very hard to imagine, of course I heardthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people,including a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived inMicrodistrict 3.They were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people whohad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku weregoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simplysavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately didwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with thathoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armeniansout and killed them on the spot. I didn't see it myself, but I heard that theyput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern fromthe corpses, well you can't call them corpses, you had to figure out from theashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, IraG., if I'm not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, andshe still can't figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped andbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of thatwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, andcarried her to the city. I still can't imagine how he managed to do that.I heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot ofpeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing asong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still hasthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song,the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. Theycouldn't find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone's apartment andcalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,she couldn't remember anyone's face.I think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I hadtalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knockedout of my head. I can't remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I sawthe Secretary of the Directorate's Party organization, where Marina works. Shegoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day atthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I'm theSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often metwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had jointmeetings. I know them all, I've even talked with them, and he, I know, is fromArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many ofthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.They took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to theProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-tified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. Theyshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they're working on ourcase, but I can't even recognize them, although it was proved that they werethe ones, they're processing it somehow. They tell me that they know thatsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they weredragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touchme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All thesepeople, all of them, as much as I've heard about them and seen them, they wereall from Kafan.The Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He wasthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn'trecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more sinceI told him, "Listen, you do something, because you know me." He turned awayand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn't see Marinaanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn't make outanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I becamemyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military peoplethere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them hisname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the onewe're part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, "Ifhe's here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either hisalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I'm crazy, notresponsible for my words." He said, "What did they do to you, how awful,myself, I hid an Armenian family." Then after some time goes by he comes backagain and says something entirely different: "I wasn't at home, my family andI went to Baku." I said, "Marina, what is he saying? He said something totallydifferent before." After that I didn't go to see our Procurator, our case isbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told methat Rzayev's case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved.What are they doing with Rzayev?Did he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in thehead I can't say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be aninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn't have to pay for it, but at thesame timeI'm afraid to say I'm a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-ter who I name, they tell me, no, you're wrong, he didn't do that, that onewasn't there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did whatexactly I can't say.When they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn't see it,because I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always gotit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason italways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating myface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed,they took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, heworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41,is where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZdormitory is over there, that's where he lives. Now he's in custody, they evenhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, theclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in ourbuilding was killed, it was that man.A guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw thathe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn't comeover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it wasall over, people started making announcements in town saying thatinvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Nowthey've caught him, everything's been proved. Now, evidently, they've beenbeating him, I don't know what they're doing with them over there, but hehimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guycame to the plant and said, "Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to thebus station on Saturday at ten." That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,went. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Fridaynight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what doyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent,probably, in their hearts they were thinking, I'm going to go. But they didn'tsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go,because he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they hadkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all ofthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says thatthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             fromI've participated in the investigation a couple of times. I'm satisfied withthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every wordI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was anArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don't know.His last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, fromMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time.His mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the AzerbaijaniKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so manyphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught atcurfew, and I've got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this,the guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat offand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in ahaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but heis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don't know what he did,I can't remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment.At the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there's no need for this,all this stuff, look me in the eyes, you're like a sister to me. I took a lookat him and thought, "My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother likeyou." But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everythingwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but whenshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled overthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on thebalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We hadall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters.They stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At thatmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing thefaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn theapartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I've got three kids andno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn't haveanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get theapartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn theapartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That's what they said. How did theyknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking thatArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of thebuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanislived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn't set fire to ourapartment.I don't know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a haltwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I wouldhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . butprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and sawthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like ata free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians werebeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would havebeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women fromour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, "Karina, wesaw all of it, how could it happen?" They're asking me! Well I just don't knowwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened tome. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn't have beenable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijaniwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipatedwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. TwoArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on thebalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. Shecame down to the entryway and said, "You'll come in this entryway over my deadbody." So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Somefolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn'teven know what they were doing. I don't think that's true. They knew very wellwhat they were doing if they didn't even lift a hand against that woman. Theycouldn't have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijanistopped them.They were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our placethey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into theapartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that?Maybe I'm losing my mind? But no, they're all chewing something. Maybe it issome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemedto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they hadcome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. Theydidn't talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. Theyscreamed and screamed: "Yeah, killing, killing, we're killing the Armenians!"Only they didn't shout "kill," they shouted "gurun ermianlary." Gurunliterally means "kill," or "destroy."That's how it was! I'll continue. We hid in a captain's apartment, he's anAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, theirkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our partof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn't findLyuda she took Papa's hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,but they didn't pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparentlythey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found thecourage to . . .A boy said to my mother "Where's the gold?" Mamma said he must have been 12to 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But theAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on thefair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma wherethe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In alittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn't really like towear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they werebought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mammathinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, andMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth,bound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They hadshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him andtore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was havingtrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him andstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wantedto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely byaccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake,"What's happened?" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, "At least go andfind out what's happening to my daughters, even if they've burned them ormurdered them, at least bring the corpses." He went looking for us. At thatmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed thatsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn't get outfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thoughtshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking toherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out fromunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had losther mind. I'll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems thatway to me, I'll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settleddown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in fromoutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don't remember what order ithappened in.And Mamma said, "Listen, they're all running around down there, shoutingsomething or other, and running toward the other building." It had more orless calmed down where we were. Who's dead, who's alive, we don't know. Itried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, "Listen;let's go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don't know howlong we'll be here. Maybe they didn't burn everything." I don't get it, allwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybenot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, "Mamma, what do you need any of thatfor? To hell with it! We're alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!" Shesays, "No, let's go get at least something. Maybe we'll leave here, spend thenight at someone else's." Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their sonAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they werecoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. Heshouts, "Come back, they're coming!" They didn't have enough time to get alot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got myknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,out of the hall . . . Someone took Father's old coveralls. The neighbor, hiswife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition toleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door andjust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs,they're dragging something again. They were going toward the other building,maybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building overthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinishedbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things moreor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.Later there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroomapartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,Asya Dallakian. She's an old woman, retired. She wasn't at home, at thattime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, andher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets herretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They startedpounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there,something like that, she's a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not evenlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames andmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television.They started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, "MyGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?" We turned off thelights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren't afraid, the ones whoknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn't know, butthey didn't come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well thathe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in hisapartment. His last name was Kasumov. He's an exserviceman, retired, works upat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.They tell him, "Comrade Captain, don't worry, we won't harm you, you're one ofus." He went upstairs, and they say, "Aren't you taking anything from thisapartment?" He says, "I don't need anything." And the women who were standingin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who werestanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on thefirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had timeto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirtypillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, reallymad, and he says, "Where's the rug? I just put it right here!" They tell him,"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school." He ran off in thatdirection.Oh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms,there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. Theyjust didn't tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man,she didn't want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she toldme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them,the ringleader, apparently a young man, said, "Where's the girl who was here?"And he became furious. The woman tells him, "She came to . . . " She didn'tknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they wouldcomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, "Shecame to and went to the basement." Now, our basement is full of water. So thewhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They tookflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had beenstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in thereto get me. Then one of them said, "There's so much water down there, sheprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death inthe basement. That's it, we can leave, no problem!" I didn't know that, andwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn'tjust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .After that we of course didn't want to live in Sumgait any longer. We reallydidn't want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there andstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all.Although the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The peoplewho sat in their apartments and didn't help us at a time like that. I thinkthat they could have helped! I don't think that they were obligated to, butthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that wholebrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have beenenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you're doing?" That'sall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Notone person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people werestanding on their balconies I didn't hear anyone's voice, no one said what areyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor womenthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped abomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up forone of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway,an old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom:if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposedto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but theystomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, "Ifyou want to go on living, you'll disappear into your apartment." So she left.That trick didn't work on them.Even the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forgetthat it happened. I said I'd only forget it if I told them right then that ithad happened to their daughter--and if that didn't have any effect on them,then I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister.And no one did anything.
