I think there is a huge difference in the materials andprocess for printer/toner PCB's. I get first time, everytimeresults from a local HP Postscript, and hardly ever works fromcopies of the same artwork. The printer results are so goodthat I have quit even looking for PC board processes. If I hadto use the copier version, I would think I would look elsewhere.The moral? Experiment and find what works. Toner transfer CANgive excellent results. It, like any process, gives erraticresults with variable inputs.R.G.
