I got the number forWestern Digital tech support and determined that I need to upgrade theBIOS to the Super BIOS.  It will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  The upgrade is $15, payable bycheck or money order.  Send to:Western Digital CorporationTechnical Support GroupP.O. Box 19665Irvine, CA  92713-9665The Super BIOS is for any WD XT hard drive controller card in theWD1002 series.The BIOS on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.The responses to my request for help follow my .sig.

C.>As I said above, the drive is a Seagate ST-251.>The system is a Compaq Portable (circa 1985).Ah, finally a question I can answer.   I mess with this olderstuff alot.   Kinda fun.  8)First problem I can forsee is that the ST-251 will not becompadible with that WD card unless it has the right bios rom.Check the numbers on it.  It should be the only non-smt chip onthe board.  Slightly below center, and left.    The bios should readeither :     62-000042-015 or62-000094-0x2If the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.>>Controller jumpers are set as follows: ("-" represents jumper)>	W1	1-2 3>       W2      1-2 3>	W3	1-2>	W4	1 2-3>	W5	1 2 3>	W6	1-2 3>	W7	1 2 3Looks right.   W5 and W7 are factory jumped (with a trace) betweenpins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.>The drive jumpers are as follows: ("8" represents jumper)Looks right.[art deleted]>Here are my questions:>>1.)	Are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?I notice you left out the S1 jumper table settings.   Those arewhat control what drive the controller thinks it has.   If you havethe 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:5 + +    open6 + +    open7 + +    open8 + +    open4 + +    closed3 + +    closed2 + +    open1 + +    openNote:   those are how WD runs the numbers on the jumper block.Top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    Pins 3,4, and 8select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select thesecond drive (drive 1).If you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and I'll haveto look up how to do it... I don't have the big book right here.>2.)	Are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?See above.  You might have problems if the S1 jumpers are notright.   Also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cablesare on right and good. 8).    On the jumper on the 251, try moving itto the opposite side of the drive.    It's one or the other.The narrow data cable goes to J2.   I've thrown it on J3 a fewtimes and banged my head for a day.....>3.)	Is my system's BIOS in need of an upgrade?Dunno.    IBM roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   A quick wayto check is to boot dos and run debug.   Enter:-d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)This will return the rom date, if it's of any use.>Keith RiceIf I oversimplified any of the above, I appologize.

These computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (IRQ2)instead of IRQ5, the IBM standard.  To modify the WD1002A-WX1 orthe WD1002-27X to operate in these systems, you must cut theetch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position W-7.  Thensolder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (W-7).  To complete themodification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch S-1(2 rows of 8 pins).  PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY PHYSICAL MODIFICATIONTO YOUR WESTERN DIGITAL HARD DISK CONTROLLER VOIDS THE WARRANTYON YOUR BOARD.  To modify the WD1004A-WX1, WDXT-GEN2 or theWD1004-27X for your Tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister mustbe soldered to jumper position W-27.  This will change theinterrupt from IRQ5 to IRQ2.XT CONTROLLERS FOR FLOPPY DISK DRIVESWD1002A-FOX - Half-slot floppy disk controller for XT or ATsystems.
