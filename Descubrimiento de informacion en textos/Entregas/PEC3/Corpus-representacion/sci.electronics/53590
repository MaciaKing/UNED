1)  Output offset:  Obtain the service manual for the oscilloscopeand adjust the internal output offset contorl.  There is virtualcertainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offsetcontrol's zero detent position.2)  Verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  Manygenerators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  Go to a hamfestflea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohmterminator that has a male and female BNC (or whatever) connectoron it.  The calibrator on my Tektronix scope is designed to put out.4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  You mayalso find that loading the output of the function generator alsoreduces the harmonic distortion.Build an attenuator.  You don't have to use (and I wouldn't want touse) the input impedance of the device under test as part of thevoltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  Consider this:------10K--------+---------? ohm ----|Gen            50 ohm            D.U.T.(loaded)         |-----------------+-------------------Think about the ratio of 50/10K and then think about the accuracyto which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  You canvirtually discount the loading of the D.U.T.  Also you have themillivolt test generator you want.Good luck,--Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED
