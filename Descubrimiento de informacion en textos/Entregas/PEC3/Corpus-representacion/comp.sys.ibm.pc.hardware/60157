HelloI have recently suffered from various problems concerningan Adaptec 1542A controller.Problem 1:Floppy disk drive doesn't work. There's apparently at least two jumperson the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. Unfortunately Ihave located only one of them (in the lower front corner). I would liketo know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where theyare located.Problem 2:My hard disks refuse to boot. With my two SCSI HD's (Rodime, Miniscribe)I get a message 'Missing operating system', even though the disks have beenformatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operatingsystem on them. If I boot from a Quantum I might get as far as gettingthe MS-DOS version information. This might of course be due to incombatiblememory drivers.Are there any jumpers that could affect the HD causing such errors?Thanks in advanceJouni_______________________________________________________________________________Jouni Marttila - Yo-kyl{ 11 B 25,  20540 Turku,  FINLAND - +358 21 374624____jmarttila@abo.fi - jmarttila@finabo - abovax::jmarttila - jjmartti@utu.fi__PGP-key available via finger jmarttila@abo.fi ___________________________
