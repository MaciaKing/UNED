This approach is the easiest and cleanest way toswitchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since,as you mentioned, nothing will know about what happened down the line.Another way to do the UPS scheme is to use the mains until youlose power, and then kick in the battery backup with it's inverter toreplace the lost power.  The problem here is the switchover time andyou've got to resync the AC in no time flat.Unfortunately, most everything is built around the assumption thatAC is available, so the UPS guys have to provide and AC output tobe usable...ya sorta have to make it work with what there already.Similar story with our telephone system.  It was first invented backin the 1800's.  We're still using the same damn system (media) as theydid back then.  If I have a phone from back then, I can assure youit'll work on today's phone system.  It costs too much to overhauleveryone to a new system, so they make it work with what is out there..
