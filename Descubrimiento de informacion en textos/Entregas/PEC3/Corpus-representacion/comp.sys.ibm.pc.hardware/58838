Since I've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding Gatewayslately on here, I thought I post my recent pleasant experiences. Mymachine (4DX2-66V) this past Friday. This was two weeks to the DAY fromwhen I called the order in.Upon unboxing it I found everything to be in perfect order. All theperipherals I ordered were properly installed (Jumbo-250 & CD-ROM). Iwas very impressed with the quantity and quality of the Gatewaydocumentation. All software came with the original disks and manuals.The Gateway manual itself is in a nice 3-ring binder. The ATI GUP camewith build59 drivers. All other software I specified (Microsoft Office)was properly installed. The machine came right up out of the box andhas been performing flawlessly. It's been on all weekend and it hardlyeven reaches room temperature. I think the big roomy tower case has alot to do with it.It's up and running DOS 6.0 with no problems. I've also read aboutsome people having problems with high speed serial communications.I used the DOS 6.0 InterLink program which lets me link to my oldcomputer via a serial port at 115.2K baud. It then "maps" the othermachines two hard disks as my disks F & G. You can "cd" to thesedrives and either run programs or copy files. It's almost like apeer-peer lan except you can also *run* programs on the other machine.It's not a two way street. The other machine is the server and thismachine is the client. So thats where it seems to differ from thepeer to peer stuff. For a bundled DOS utility its very impressive.My Jumbo-250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117MB of data. I alsoby-passed any potential Gateway monitor problems by taking the $430credit and applying it towards a NEC 4FG. I love this monitor!So, I'm glad there is some good news Gateway stories and I'm glad itwas me. (Now if it just KEEPS working). :-)John--John Gayman, WA3WBUUUCP: uunet!wa3wbu!johnPacket: WA3WBU @ WB3EAH
