Nntp-Posting-Host: logic.clarkson.eduX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]Hi.  I was doing research on subliminal suggestion for a psychologypaper, and I read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on theTV screen at 1/200ths of a second.  Is that possible?  I thought themaximum rate the TV was even capable of displaying images was 1/30thof a second.  (or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only oddor even scan lines)- Richkennehra@logic.camp.clarkson.edu
