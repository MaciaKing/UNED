My name is clearly visible in the headers, and Ising the post with my account name. If you have a problem with that,then you will have to get over it. I've used this account name for over10 years and the people who have been reading newsgroups for the last 7generally recognize "Hades" as my account name. I have no intention ofchanging the way I post.>I installed a couple of 16MB SIMMs in my Quadra and was somewhat dismayed>by the general complexity of the operation compared to, for example, the>wonderfully designed LC III.

That is what Apple Service Techs get paid todo. I personally like the design of the Q800, and applaud Apple forcoming up with a good way to make use of the front space for all ofthose drive bays. I like it a lot better than the 900/950 design, exceptfor those people who need Drive Arrays. I do, however, agree with youabout the LW Pro design.>The operation isn't very complicated if even a minimal amount of help were>offered but Apple leaves you working blind.Again, its's not Apple's place to make it easy for non-certifiedservice people to fool around with Apple hardware, even if they did buyit. Of course you are free to do what you want to your Mac, just don'tget upset when your Apple Service Rep tells you that your warranty is nolonger valid.>After the memory was installed I was distraught that the top of the SIMMs>came into contact with the plastic case frame.

The standard 4MB SIMMs would contact the top of the case andmake it a bit difficult to close the LC, but it did close and work justfine. One of the nice things about Logic-Boards is that they aregenerally quite flexible and can withstand a fair amount of pressure.-Hades
