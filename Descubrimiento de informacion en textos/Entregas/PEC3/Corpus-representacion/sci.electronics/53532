The stuff they will stock are the onesthat'll sell, like standard DRAM's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.i.e.  I cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.The closest you can get is to pick up a copy of Byte magazine orthe Circuit Cellar, Popular Electronics, and the like and flipthrough them.Distributors like Wyle Electronics, Hamilton Avnet, Pioneer Electronics,etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves wherewe only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buyby the hundreds or more.  Each distributor represents and sells a variety ofdifferent non-competing manufacturers.  What do I mean by this?Suppose ABC Electronics sells Intel 80386's.  It's a pretty goodbet that they won't be selling any of AMD's 386's, or vice-versa.They also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturerthey represent.Who knows?  You might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.But I'd be suprised if you do.  ALso bear in mind that the 1 or 2qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than whata mail order outlet will charge.My advice?  If you're gonna be designing anything, try to stickwith off-the-shelf stuff.  You're going to get stuck if you usetoo many esoteric parts sooner or later.good luck,aaron
