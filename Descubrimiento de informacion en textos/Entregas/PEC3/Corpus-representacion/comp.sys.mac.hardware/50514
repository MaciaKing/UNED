BTW, the deal>I have is a C650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better>deal?I don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that theprice of the C650 is going to drop this year.  This week's MacWeekreports that Apple is probably planning a drop in August.  My guessis that it may come sooner if Apple decides to  change the pricestructure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.Your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then I payed formine last month.  I would have rather waited for one of the newmachines this sommer (like the Cyclone) but the resale value of myIIci would have not been squat by then.  Thus, financing forced meto purchase now.  I'm happy with the machine and won't feelbetrayed at all when Apple cuts the price to less then $1000 nextweek (heh).Bottome line:  If the C650 does what you want, buy it.  If you waituntil the Cylcones come out for a price break then you might aswell wait for the PowerPCs to come out for another price break andthen the units which follow them.  You may save some money butyou've lost a lot of time when you could have been using thecomputer.  Face it, Apple's prices are going to be in a continuousstate of flux.  At least they aren't going to try raising themagain (grin).-JohnKomp@leonardo.src.honeywell.com
