Well, I just got my Centris 610 yesterday.  It took just over twoweeks from placing the order.  The dealer (Rutgers computer store)appologized because Apple made a substitution on my order.  I orderedthe one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.He wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  They mustbe backlogged on Centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping themwith!Anyway, I'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.Being nosy, I decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the firsttime.  The SCSI cable to the hard drive was only partially connected(must have come loose in shipping).  No big deal, but I would have beenpissed if I tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!The hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  I'veheard apple will exchange it if you complain, so I might try to getit swapped.I am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  Thiswasn't mentioned in any of the literature I saw.  Also, the locationof the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  Having keyboard control forthese functions was much more convenient.Oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.I've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...Anyway, above all, it's fast.  A great machine at a great price!gnelson@physics.rutgers.edu
