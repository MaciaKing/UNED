Nntp-Posting-Host: astro.ocis.temple.eduX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]This may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there away to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)to get the usual 8?  My case has slots for 8, and I'd like toget a scanner, but with all my other cards I'm already max'd out!I'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turnsone slot into three.  I don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,as I can put my I/O card, MIDI card, and Soundblaster card there.My other cards are 16 bit (IDE/Floppy, SVGA, modem).If there is such an expander, does that screw up performance ofeverything else?  I'd hate to buy a new motherboard! :-(--Carl Christensen                /~~\_/~\        ,,,  Dept. of Computer Sciencechristen@astro.ocis.temple.edu |  #=#==========#   | Temple University"Curiouser and curiouser!" - LC \__/~\_/        ```  Philadelphia, PA  USA
