IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE CAERE TYPIST PLUS GRAPHICSHAND SCANNER, PLEASE READ ON AND SAVE MY LIFE.........My problem is that my Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will notconnect to my PowerBook 160.The cable from the scanner will not fit the SCSI port of the computer.I managed to gaet a cabled assembled that adapted the cord to thecomputer. However, this placed the computer into SCSI mode, that is itacted as an external hard disk whenever i switched the computer on.I've asked an engineer in London to assemble a new Cable for me. Buthe's taken 14 weeks and has yet to find the solution, out of sheerlaziness. And I know that a cable exists to solve the problem.If you know the solution. Please let me know what cable I need and how Ican get hold of one.My E-Mail address is :zia@uk.ac.ed.castleI will be truely grateful for all your help.Thanking you in advance,Zia.
