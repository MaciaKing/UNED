In article <1993Apr15.202811.29312@CSD-NewsHost.Stanford.EDU>,andy@SAIL.Stanford.EDU (Andy Freeman) says:>>>I have been at a shooting range where>>gang members were "practicing" shooting.>>How do "we" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops>or even law-abiding menacing minorities.  BTW - Why the sneer quotes?>"We" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right onthe border of the west side of Chicago.  That is a gang infested area.  Thereare many, many bad things going on in that area.  Also, I have several friendsthat live very close to that area who have had problems with some of thesefolks.  By the way, where did I say that they were minorities?  Do you thinkthat only minorities have gangs?  Not so.  As far as the quotes are concernedit was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship.  Idon't know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship bytaking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.  Ifyou would have been there Andy it would've been obvious to you too.  Of courseit might not have been.  Who knows.  All I do know is that I was there, I livehere and I know that they were gang bangers.  When you live here long enough itbecomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.  One lastthing.  My sister is a social worker.  She makes it her point to find thesethings out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to doso.  She is nice enough to let me know these things so I can watch out formyself as I live right on the border of the west side of the city. Enough said.Jason
