Approved: gun-control@cs.umd.edu[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try andclarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws.I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email,followup to t.p.g.1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to geta concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what Iwas told by a police officer.2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) toprotect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Gunsmust be stored locked up and unloaded, however.3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who willbe exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/formauthorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers willbe allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possessthem, but will not be allowed to stock them.4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits willnot be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulationsspecify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Somemanufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.(God knows how much they'll charge for these)This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory,do not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.---------------------------------------------------------------------| Keith P. de Solla, P.Eng |  IPSC Ontario, OHA, NFA, SFC, OFAH   || keith@orion.ic.cmc.ca    |  Frontenac Rifle and Pistol Club     |-------------------------------------------------------------------
