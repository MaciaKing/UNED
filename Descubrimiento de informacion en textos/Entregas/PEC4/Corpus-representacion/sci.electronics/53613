A surplus-dealing buddy of mine came up with two emulator pods:HP64220C (for HP 64100 development station). 8086 targetprocessor. DIP head. Does not include board that plugs intothe 64100.Applied Microsystems 80C186/188 pod, LCC head.If you have an interest in either, let me know. They look tobe in excellent condition. He doesn't know what to do with them, whichmay mean that they'll be cheap.----------------------------------------------------------------------Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)Intergraph Corp.M/S GD3004 		Internet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.comHuntsville, AL 35894		UUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) ******** The opinions expressed here are mine (or those of my machine)
