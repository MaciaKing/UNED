NNTP-Posting-Host: statler.engin.umich.eduOriginator: towwang@statler.engin.umich.eduA silly question: I frequently edit small files and need to make copies of themon several floppy diskettes of the same size and format, but my computer isonly equipped with one 3.5" HD drive and one 5.25" HD drive; can't I do thecopying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk (which is 99.9% full)using standard MSDOS 5.0 commands? I knowdiskcopy a: a:works but for small selections of files,xcopy a:*.txt a:does not!Maybe I'll have to write my own file copy command in C, but the idea does notamuse me.Thanks for your help.Francisco
