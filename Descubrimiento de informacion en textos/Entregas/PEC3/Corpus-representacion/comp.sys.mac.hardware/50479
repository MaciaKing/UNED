NNTP-Posting-Host: network.ucsd.eduI've got the official word on the LaserWriter Pro 600 memoryupgrade.I just got off of the phone with the quite friendly Donna Rossiat Apple Customer Assistance.  She tells me that those whopurchased the LaserWriter Pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, nogreyscale) configuration should contact their original dealerswho are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  For thosewho don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpior greyscale (at 300dpi).If the dealers have questions, they should be directed to theirhardware support numbers and/or Apple Customer Assistance1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).Regards,GlennP.S. - personally, I'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  Theyreally have an obligation to provide this information to allof the customers who purchased the 600 in the originalconfiguration (they have the records...that's why they ask forthings like a phone number).  When I get my upgrade completed,I'm going to write Apple and complain.
