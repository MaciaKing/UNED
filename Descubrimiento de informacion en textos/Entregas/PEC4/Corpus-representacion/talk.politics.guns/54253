You know, I was reading 18 U.S.C. 922 and something just did not makesence and I was wondering if someone could help me out.Say U.S.C. 922 :(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful forany person to transfer or possess a machinegun.Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a "person"might also be an artificial entity that is created by governmentand has no rights under the federal constitution. So, what Idon't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced onan individual. So someone tell me how my government can tellme what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a lawdoes not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitionaluntil it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, notjust your run of the mill "Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail"Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was toldby the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right?--Brian Sheets		    _   /|  	"TRUCK?!
