I need a off-the-shelf method of transmitting small amounts of data up to300 feet.  The data is low speed and can be encoded as needed.  Low poweron the transmitting end would be a plus.  An FCC certified product wouldbe prefered.If you have any pointers to products or companies I'd appreciate hearing fromyou.Thanks,Ken
