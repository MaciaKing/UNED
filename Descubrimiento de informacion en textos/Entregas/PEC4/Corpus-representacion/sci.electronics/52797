The DSP is available in kit form for about $120.This particular DSP filter was targetted toward processing audio to removenoise (static).  I built it and it really works well.  The source code isavailable too.  It makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  Note thatthis is for communication applications and is not "high fidelity".--- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - + - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - +Mike Linnig, Texas Instruments Inc. | 97.43% of all statistics are made |Phone: (214) 575-3597  CALL: N5QAW  | up; most of them (83.6 percent)   |Internet: mike.linnig@dseg.ti.com   | are wrong.                        |- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
