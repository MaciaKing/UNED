Does anyone have any experience using LCIII with MIDI?  Do they get along OK?I have heard that the IIvx is not suitable for MIDI, but I have not heard anyone say anything definitive about LCIII and MIDI?  If you have had experience, what MIDI interface have you used?  Anyone used Finale software in this setting?Please e-mail.  I will summarize.Thanks,Jerry BartlettPeoria, Illiniosu56149@uicvm.cc.uic.edu
