I was thinking about who on each of the teams were the MVPs, biggestsurprises, and biggest disappointments this year. Now, these are justmy observations and are admittedly lacking because I have not had anopportunity to see all the teams the same amount. Anyway....MVP = most valuable player to his team both in terms of points andin terms of leadership ("can't win without him")Biggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the playerthat may have raised the level of his game to a new height, evenif that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth(includes those players who at the outset of the season, may noteven have been in the team's plans).Biggest disappointment = the player from whom we expected more (e.g., Ipicked Denis Savard in Montreal because with the new emphasis onoffence brought by Demers, shouldn't Savard have done better?)-----------------------------------------------------------------------Team           Biggest       BiggestTeam:                   MVP:          Surprise:    Disappointment:-----------------------------------------------------------------------Boston Bruins           Oates          D.Sweeney     WesleyBuffalo Sabres          Lafontaine     Mogilny       Audette (jinx?)Calgary Flames          Roberts        Reichel       PetitChicago Blackhawks      Roenick        Ruuttu        GouletDetroit Red Wings       Yzerman        Chaisson      KozlovEdmonton Oilers         Manson         Buchberger    MellanbyHartford Whalers        Sanderson      Cassells      CorriveauLos Angeles Kings       Robitaille     Donnelly      HrudeyMinnesota North Stars   Modano      Tinordi(not expected back)  BrotenMontreal Canadiens      Muller         Lebeau        SavardNew Jersey Devils       Stevens        Semak         MacLeanNew York Islanders      Turgeon        King(finally) MaroisNew York Rangers        Messier        Kovalev       BourqueOttawa Senators         MacIver        Baker         JelinekPhiladelphia Flyers     Lindros/Recchi Fedyk/Galley  EklundPittsburgh Penguins     Lemieux        Tocchet(even for him)  JagrQuebec Nordiques        Sakic/Ricci    Kovalenko     PearsonSan Jose Sharks         Kisio          Gaudreau      MaleySt Louis Blues          Shanahan       C.Joseph      Ron SutterTampa Bay Lightening    Bradley        Bradley       Creighton/KasperToronto Maple Leafs     Gilmour        Potvin        Ellett/AndersonVancouver Canucks       Bure           Nedved(finally)    MomessoWashington Capitals     Hatcher        Bondra/Cote   ElynuikWinnipeg Jets           Selanne        Selanne       Druce----------------------------------------------------------------------As I mentioned up top, these are my *impressions* from where I sit.
