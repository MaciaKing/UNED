I missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having achance to read the news for a couple of days...The idea is commercialized in at least one product, the PrivateEye.  That's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps aroundthe head similar to a sweat band.  There is a boom that comes fromthe side on which the device is mounted so that it is positionedin front of the user's eye.The Private Eye we had here for evaluation was Hercules-MDAcompatible.  The innards are a row (~400 LEDs) that are swept upand down by a galvonometer-like movement.  The result is that thesweeping LED bar forms a fused raster.  There is a virtual imageprojected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fusewith the background.I didn't like the device very much.  I found it easiest to use if Ilooked at a blank white wall.  I had problems with focus trackingif I glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.The unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which I foundannoying.  Some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  Properlyused, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.I don't know if the company has taken the technology any further inthe last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.--Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED
