Message-ID: <1qkg3d$1is@hcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com>NNTP-Posting-Host: hcx1.ssd.csd.harris.comI'm looking for a complete hw/sw solution:I need an ISA/VLB scsi controller (e.g Ultrastor 34F)plus a tape drive (500Mb or less like Archive) plus a Windowsprogram that will work on these.My intended system will have 32Mb RAM soplain ISA controllers will no longer do.But I also hear that the SCSI worldis not very organized.So does anybody have a tape backup setuplike what I'm looking for ? Pleasedescribe it.Thanks. e-mail please.--marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com
