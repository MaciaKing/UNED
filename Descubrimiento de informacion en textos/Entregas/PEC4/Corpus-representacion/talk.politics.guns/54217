Alas, this is not provable. I think that that> there are actually *few* cases where this is so.excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:Although less apparent to those who have not researchedthe facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  assport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recentresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  StateUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handgunsare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  bycriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  inthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  whenyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  becauseof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abidingprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  studyof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crimebecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,and  57% agreed that "most criminals are more worried  aboutmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into thepolice."2One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  thewomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observationthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  inresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   Thisshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of OrlandoFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  femalepopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  justthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns andobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  forthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  toexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapesshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completionrate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,the completion rate drops to 3%.1 G Kleck, Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America Aldinede Gruyter, NY, 19912 JD Wright & PH Rossi Armed and Considered Dangerous:  ASurvey of Felons and Their Firearms, Aldine de Gruyter, NY,1986-------__________________________________________________________________________[unlike cats] dogs NEVER scratch you when you wash them.
