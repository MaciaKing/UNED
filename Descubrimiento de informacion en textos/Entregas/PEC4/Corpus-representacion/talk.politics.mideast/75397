Jack considers the Jewish peopleto be responsible for all the acts of the supporters of Israel, irrespective oftheir age, religion, gender, skin color, or sexual orientation.The .sig, please.Bill R.--"The only proposals in the Senate that I         "My opinions do not representhave seen fit to mention are particularly        those of my employer orpraiseworthy or particularly scandalous ones.    any government agency."It seems to me that the historian's foremost     - Bill Riggsduty is to ensure that virtue is remembered,and to deter evil words and deeds with thefear of posterity's damnation."- Tacitus, _Annals_ III. 65
