The Orders for the Turkish Extermination of the Armenians #17To the children of genocide: "Send them away into the Desert"This is part of a continuing series of articles containing official Turkishwartime (WW1) governmental telegrams, in translation, entailing the ordersfor the extermination of the Armenian people in Turkey. Generally, thesetelegrams were issued by the Turkish Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha,for example, we have the following set regarding children:"To the Government of Aleppo.November 5, 1915. We are informed that the little ones belonging tothe Armenians from Sivas, Mamuret-ul-Aziz, Diarbekir and Erzeroum[hundreds of km distance from Aleppo] are adopted by certain Moslemfamilies and received as servants when they are left alone throughthe death of their parents. We inform you that you are to collectall such children in your province and send them to the places ofdeportation, and also to give the necessary orders regarding this tothe people.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [1]"To the Government of Aleppo.September 21, 1915. There is no need for an orphanage. It is not thetime to give way to sentiment and feed the orphans, prolonging theirlives. Send them away to the desert and inform us.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [2]"To the General Committee for settling and deportees.November 26, 1915. There were more than four hundred children in theorphanage. They will be added to the caravans and sent to theirplaces of exile.Abdullahad Nuri. [3]"To the Government of Aleppo.January 15, 1916. We hear that certain orphanages which have beenopened receive also the children of the Armenians. Whether this isdone through the ignorance of our real purpose, or through contemptof it, the Government will regard the feeding of such children orany attempt to prolong their lives as an act entirely opposed to itpurpose, since it considers the survival of these children asdetrimental. I recommend that such children shall not be receivedinto the orphanages, and no attempts are to be made to establishspecial orphanages for them.Minister of the Interior,Talaat." [4]"To the Government of Aleppo.Collect and keep only those orphans who cannot remember the torturesto which their parents have been subjected. Send the rest away withthe caravans.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [5]"From the Ministry of the Interior to the Government of Aleppo.At a time when there are thousands of Moslem refugees and the widowsof Shekid [fallen soldiers] are in need of food and protection, it isnot expedient to incur extra expenses by feeding the children left byArmenians, who will serve no purpose except that of giving troublein the future. It is necessary that these children should be turnedout of your vilayet and sent with the caravans to the place ofdeportation. Those that have been kept till now are also to be sentaway, in compliance with our previous orders, to Sivas.Minister of the Interior,Talaat" [6]In 1926, Halide Edip (a pioneer Turkish nationalist) wrote in her memoirsabout a conversation with Talaat Pasha, verifying and "rationalizing" thisultra-national fascist anti-Armenian mentality, the following:"I have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best forits own interest, and succeeds, the world admires it and thinksit moral. I am ready to die for what I have done, and I know Ishall die for it." [7]These telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the 1923 trial ofTalaat Pasha's, assassin, Soghomon Tehlerian. The Turkish government neverquestioned these "death march orders" until 1986, during a time when the worldwas again reminded of the genocide of the Armenians.For reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial, theTurkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders wereever issued, and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on astudy by S. Orel and S. Yuca of the Turkish Historical Society.If one were to examine the sample "authentic text" provided in the TurkishHistorical Society study and use their same forgery test on that sample, ittoo would be a forgery!. In fact, if any of the tests delineated by theTurkish Historical Society are performed an any piece of Ottoman Turkish orPersian/Arabic script, one finds that anything handwritten in such language isa forgery.Today, the body of Talaat Pasha lies in a tomb on Liberty Hill, Istanbul,Turkey, just next to the Yildiz University campus. The body of this genocidearchitect was returned to Turkey from Germany during WW2 when Turkey was in aheightened state of proto-fascism. Recently, this monument has served as afocal point for anti-Armenianism in Turkey.This monument represents the epitome of the Turkish government's pathologicaldenial of a clear historical event and is an insult to a people whose onlycrime was to be born Armenian.- - - references - - -[1] _The Memoirs of Naim Bey_, Aram Andonian, 1919, pages 59-60[2] ibid, page 60[3] ibid, page 60[4] ibid, page 61[5] ibid, page 61[6] ibid, page 62[7] _Memoirs of Halide Edip_, Halide Edip, The Century Press, New York (andLondon), 1926, page 387--David Davidian dbd@urartu.sdpa.org   | "How do we explain Turkish troops onS.D.P.A.
