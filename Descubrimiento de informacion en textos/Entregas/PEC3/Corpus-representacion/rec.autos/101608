I bought a car with a defunct engine, to use for partsfor my old but still running version of the same car.The car I bought has good tires.Is there anything in particular that I should do tostore the defunct car long-term?  I'd hate to haveparts of it go bad.  Someone has told me it's badfor the tires to not move the car once-in-a-while.Is this true?   Do I need some props to take theweight of the tires?Best to reply by mail, I am getting spotty news delivery.Kris A. Kugel	908-842-2707hico2!kak	kak@hico2.westmark.com
