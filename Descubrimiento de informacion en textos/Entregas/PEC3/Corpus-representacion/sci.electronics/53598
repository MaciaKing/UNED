One thing to consider is time division multiplexing the EMGchannels to reduce the number of RF carriers you have to generate.If you multiplexed the EMG inputs at 10KHz, that would probably besufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 Hz perchannel sampling rate.)  That level of analog multiplexing shouldbe rather easy to accomplish.Combining a lot of RF carriers is pretty tricky to do withoutgenerating intermodulation.  A system to be carried by a runner isin a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult tokeep balanced.A commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed witha little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.Obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever lawsgovern the use of transeivers in your location.--Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED
