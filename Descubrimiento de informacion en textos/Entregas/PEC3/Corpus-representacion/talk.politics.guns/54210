Probably got a real gut-buster goingwhen the IRA blew that kid up a couple of weeks ago, huh?

Where the criminals don't bother with checking to seeif the victims are home.  They just break on in.  America's a littledifferent, you see.  Criminals worry a bit more about getting shot,so they more frequently check to see if anyone's home.>I knew somebody else who went to one of your "Gun-mart" superstore places, just>so he could experience the sight of people putting guns and ammo into shopping>carts!

Isn't that the place where you're guilty untilproven innocent?  Tell me, Mr. "jaj@vax.oxford.ac.uk" didn't Britaincome begging to us "gun nut morons" in the early 1940s for guns todefend yourselves against Hitler?  Seems as though your supposedlyenlightened government had disarmed you: "Aw chaps, you can jollygive up your guns.  If that Hitler man starts to threaten, we canalways hit up the Yanks for a few guns.  They've got a bloodyeccentric habit about those guns, you know.  Just hand in yourshotgun, that's it.

Damn if thosedrugs from south america keep coming over our borders, too, eventhough we've banned them.
