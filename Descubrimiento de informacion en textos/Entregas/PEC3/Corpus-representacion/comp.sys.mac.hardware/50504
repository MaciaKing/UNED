Nntp-Posting-Host: ironman.ms.nwu.eduI'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a VGAmonitor (an IBM 8513 sold w/ many PS/2's to be exact) on the Mac LC III.All of the vendors I have called say that the internal video will not workon a true VGA monitor but will work on a IBM Compatible multisync like thesony's or the NEC monitors.  I thought the VGA capability of LCIII was veryattractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive VGA monitors.  Am Iconfused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  Has anyone used anLCIII with a non multisync VGA monitor and if so where did you get youradapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  I would prefer to get aapple monitor for these LCIII's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside anIBM bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more LCIII's we canafford and the more PS/2's we can get rid of!Charles KuehmannNorthwestern UniversitySteel Research Groupqman@casbah.acns.nwu.edu
