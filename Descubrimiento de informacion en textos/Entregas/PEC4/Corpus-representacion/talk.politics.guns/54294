It is my opinion that most educatedor well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough timewill tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it wascreated for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented pressportrays a group of people as "nuts" or crazies, a violation of thosepeople's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have thegurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or riskvoted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper withdomocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore theofficial press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat topublic safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the veryagency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to theiradvantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If theywere portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justificationwhat so ever of doing what they did.So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Daltonleads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to beunconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involvedin this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting tofind out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possiblyunconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).****************************************************************************The above opinions are mine and mine only.I'm solely responsible for my opinions and my actions.
