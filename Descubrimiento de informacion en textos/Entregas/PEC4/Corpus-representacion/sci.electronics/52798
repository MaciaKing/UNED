Distribution: worldMessage-ID: <1phic0INNg35@crcnis1.unl.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: unlinfo.unl.eduIs there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs whenan inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing ofthe AC cycle?  A capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?I've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumpsin a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched withzero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays "quiet", AC-wise.But there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relayin the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under controlof my SSRs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resetsone of my peripheral chips.  My software times out and tries again, butI'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid havingto do some major rewiring/redesign.  A varistor would help but might notbe sufficient.
