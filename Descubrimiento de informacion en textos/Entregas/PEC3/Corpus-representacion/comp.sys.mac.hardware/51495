Distribution: usaMessage-ID: <1qk2rjINN503@cae.cad.gatech.edu>NNTP-Posting-Host: cae.cad.gatech.eduThere's this old SE here. It's got the older-style fans that remindme of a house-ventilator. A cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotorI usually see. Anyway, the SE makes this loud buzzing noise dueto vibration somewheres. If I remove the screws and loosen the frontfrom the back, it quiets down. I can only assume that the fan housingfrom this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibratingagainst it.Anyway, any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to"stealth" this guy?
