Hi,I am looking for some help in choosing a packagefor a high-speed silicon ADC (100Mhz) currently beingfabricated. This is a PhD research project and I have to testthe chip at speed on a PCB. I expect to have roughly 100packaged circuits and will do DC, low-speed and high-speedtesting using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.I know for sure that a DIP will not work(the long lead lines have too high an inductance).Getting a custom-made package is too expensive, soI am trying to choose between a flatpak and aleadless chip carrier. The flatpack would be hardto test since it has to be soldered on to the testsetup and I would spend loads of time solderingas I kept changing the test chip. The leadless chipcarrier sockets also have long lead lines and maynot work at high speeds.Does anyone out there have experience/knowledgeof this field ? I would greatly appreciate help! Any ideas/names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packageswould help.P.S. The multi-layer fancy GaAs packages seem like a bitof overkill(?)--- Seema Varma
