Apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too muchpower, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. Howdoes one get around that without designing a new chipset? Use existingPowerBook technology to your best advantage. The Duo Dock gives Apple aunique ability to give users that 040 power in a "Semi-Portable" fashion.By plunking the 040 into the Dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk.On the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.Okay, not the BEST solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)So, does this mean one will be able to use the PowerBook's processor inparallel to the dock's processor? Okay, we're getting REALLY hypotheticalnow...--Travis Grundke		    | MacGames Digest- Your #1 Source for Information,Contributing Editor,	    | News & Reviews of Gaming Software and the GamingMacGames Digest	 	    | Industry in the Macintosh Community.
