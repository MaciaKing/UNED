Nntp-Posting-Host: vm.temple.eduX-Newsreader: NNR/VM S_1.3.2I have to increase the memory in a Plus or SE (I'm not sure which sinceI haven't seen it yet). I did this a few years ago but I no longer have theinstructions. I forget which resistor needs to be cut to go from 1 to 4 Mbs.Can anyone direct me to this information? Is there an ftp'able doc some-where with diagrams?Thanks, Dick Grant
