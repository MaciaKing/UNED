NNTP-Posting-Host: slab.mtholyoke.eduX-Newsreader: Tin 1.1 PL5I've noticed some of you mentioning owning a Quadra 800 8/230 with CD300and 1meg of VRAM.  It seems that this configuration was purchasedcomplete; that is, the CD300 and VRAM were already installed in the box.I am interested in that exact configuration and will be buying with aneducational discount but have not found the CD300 bundled with any Q800smaller than the 8/500.If you bought or know how to buy the 8/230 with CD installed, please letme know what you know via email:send messages to dmaluso@mhc.mtholyoke.eduThanks, all.Diane Maluso=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-==     Diane Maluso            INTERNET:  dmaluso@mhc.mtholyoke.edu     ==     Department of Psychology and Education                           ==     Mount Holyoke College                                            ==     South Hadley, MA  01075                                          ==     (413) 538-2107                                                   ==-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
