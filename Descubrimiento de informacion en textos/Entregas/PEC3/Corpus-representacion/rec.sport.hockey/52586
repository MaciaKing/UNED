With the kind of team Montreal has now,  they can take thecup easily.  The only problem they have right now is that everyone istrying to steal the show and play alone.  They need some massive teamwork.They are also in a little of a slump because long-time hockeyMontreal Canadiens announcer Claude Mouton died last tuesday and it wasrough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21years.  But I know that is no excuse.  But if the Habs manage to get somegood teamwork and get into the spirit,  they should have no problemwinning in May.Dean
