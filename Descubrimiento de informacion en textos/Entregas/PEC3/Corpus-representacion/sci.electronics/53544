We have a Sun CD-ROM drive which I would like to play audio CD's in.I have an old 10 watt amplifier which works fine when connected to ajunk "Walkman" style AM/FM radio. This amp ties the common path of theearphone connection to ground.However, it doesn't work with my Sony Walkman cassette player, or the CD drive,it produces of loud low-frequency tone. Obviously Sony doesn't groundthe earphone output common. Does anyone have specs on the CD drive'soutput? Will an audio transformer help? What are others using toplay there CD's in the Sun drive so that more than one can listen?Thanks for the help.--Bill Morrow    Clinical Neurosciences, University of Calgarye-mail: morrow@cns.ucalgary.ca voice: (403) 220-6275 fax: (403) 283-87703330 Hospital Drive NW Calgary, Alberta, CANADA T2N 4N1
