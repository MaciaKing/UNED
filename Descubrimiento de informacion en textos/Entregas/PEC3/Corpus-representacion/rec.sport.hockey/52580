St.John's Nfld, CanadaDate: Tue, 6 Apr 1993 00:05:52 GMTTSN Sportsdesk just reported that the OTTAWA SUN has reported thatMontreal will send 4 players + $15 million including Vin Damphousseand Brian Bellows to Phillidelphia, Phillie will send Eric Lindrosto Ottawa, and Ottawa will give it's first round pick to Montreal.If this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not Ottawagets to choose 1st overall.  Can Ottawa afford Lindros' salary?Personally, I can't see Philli giving up Lindros -- for anything.They didn't give away that much to Quebec just to trade him awayagain.  Not to mention that Lindros seems to be a *huge* draw inPhillie -- and that he represents a successful future for thefranchise.Ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from Montrealfor the pick.Stephen LeggeSLEGGE@kean.ucs.munc.ca
