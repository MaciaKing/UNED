All you people who aredrooling after this chip do realize that it has no FPU, just like486SX, that Evil Marketing Ploy(tm) from Intel, don't you? It has 16Kof internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon realestate went. Because of some contract, IBM is not allowed to sell its486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to becomeavailable in any non-IBM machines. Of course, nothing prevents othercompanies from implementing a DX3/99, but nobody hasn't even come outwith a real 486DX (FPU and all) clone yet (although AMD soon will).--Segmented Memory Helps Structure Software
