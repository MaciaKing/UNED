If the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to bethere] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 voltsupply.  Several sets I've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  Theregulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuitsshut down the EHT supply section.Try putting the set on a Variac or adjustable transformer and lowerthe AC input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  If the setoperates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.There are myriad other areas for problems, but I've seen the oneabove several times.  Also, if the set uses one, the tripplermodule may be shot; that's fairly common.--Bill Mayhew      NEOUCOM Computer Services DepartmentRootstown, OH  44272-9995  USA    phone: 216-325-2511wtm@uhura.neoucom.edu (140.220.1.1)    146.580: N8WED
