If you know anything about the Caere Typist PlusGraphics Hand Scanner, Please read and solve my problem. I will betruely grateful for the rest of my life!The problem is that My Caere Typist Plus Graphics Hand Scanner will notconnect to my PowerBook 160. The Cable on the Scanner will not fit intothe SCSI port on the PowerBook.I then got a cable assembled to adapt the original cable to fit the SCSIport. This, however, turned the computer into SCSI mode and treated itas a hard disk.I have asked an engineer in London to assembled a new cable. The idiot,out of sheer laziness has taken 14 weeks and has yet to solve theproblem.I am aware that Caere Co. in the US have a solution.Do you know of a cable that will solve this problem.
