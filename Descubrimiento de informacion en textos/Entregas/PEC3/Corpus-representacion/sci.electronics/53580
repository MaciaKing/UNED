Dear NettersI want to send EMG-signals from a running person to a computer.Each signal is 4KHz wide and there is up to 30 of them on eachrunning person. The signal is only to be sent over a few hundredmeters. It seems to me that the frequency intended for this use isabout 150MHz and about 440MHz.To make the transmitters as light as possible I suppose it will be bestthe to send the signals in an analog form. As this application is ratherspecialized I do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-units i need.On the other hand I imagine that I can buy the receiver somewhere. Ineed a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 completereceivers in some rack system where one can add as many receiversas needed in the particular case.DO ANYBODY KNOW IF THERE IS EXISTING SUCH RECEIVERSYSTEM ON THE MARKET?baldur@rsp.is     (TF3BP) (please respond by email rather than nn)
