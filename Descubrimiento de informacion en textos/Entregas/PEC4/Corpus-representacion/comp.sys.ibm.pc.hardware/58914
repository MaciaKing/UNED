AY>  In many recent advertisements I have seen both "486DX-50" and "486DXAY>based systems. Does the first really exists and does it imply that allAY>circuitry on the motherboard with it works at that speed, as oppositeAY>latter, where only the internals of the CPU are working at 50MHz?AY>AY> Many thanx in advance!AY>AY>Andrew.Andrew, yes there is a DX and DX2 version of the 50MHz 486.  If you areconsidering buying one or the other, definitely go for the DX with a nicesize external cache!  The performance is far greater.The DX2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50MHz, while the DXhas a potentially much larger cache to work at 50MHz with.  Neithersystems could actually run a program out of main memory, since DRAM isstill too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66MHz < 50MHz ).-rdd---. WinQwk 2.0b#0 .
