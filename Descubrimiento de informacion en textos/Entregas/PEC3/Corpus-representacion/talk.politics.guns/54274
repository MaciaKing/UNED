One of his best throwaway lines was toremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had beenchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while thepeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of"election fraud" to hold their jobs.Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons andsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, andtelling people where to find their own representatives (and in toomany cases, who they were).Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules anddiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems adelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma materof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) wasbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms orammo to anyone who is not a state resident.The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) GardnerAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor'shearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusivehusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonholeour representatives, after which we would be squashed into aninadequate hearing room.One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.He said, "Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby isalways so organized every year."  I got a little pissed, and replied,"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district."At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice ademonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where thepro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in hismirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, andseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun "close-the-loophole" protestors.(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there wereabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachersfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never gotcloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  Acop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of thecrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeakerwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheetsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed upto "support GOAL's position" on "all bills."First, because of their time constraints, public officials got totestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the studentshad some curfew, I guess).Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase longguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws ofhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only tonon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rockfolks called the current law a "loophole" and wanted it closed.Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his "SKS assault rifle."The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so wellthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallerycorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimedthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he waslying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoiningstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state "as strong as"that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  "In some ofthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!"(Oooooo!)  "We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; ifonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn'tbe having this situation -- but they won't."  (Naughty, naughty!)Next up was Boston city councilman Albert "Dapper" O'Neill.  He wasthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He'sreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he'salmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed theACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he werejudge, he'd give arrestees their "last rights" (pun intended) on thespot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in theright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind aCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed arestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restrainingorder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favorof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have toget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts haveconvicted."  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuousperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewableevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The statedpurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible."Revenue has nothing to do with it."  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, somecongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument thatit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in thevague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle thelaw-abiding instead of the crook.The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both "restrainingorder" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let anybad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (Hewas a co-sponsor of one of the "restraining order" bills as well.)  Oneof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) wasvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was inthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, "everyyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap..."It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have beenmore effective.At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop becausethe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker wasdisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us hadto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the "public"testimony; the other got a seat this time.Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left thestate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and thathis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Greatquote: "If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the statecomputer system until 1999."  (This was also an argument he usedagainst the renewable FID card.)Testimony was heard from several "battered women," one of whom hadbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because hegot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion andsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney GeneralHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these womenneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order wasgranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whetherthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would besatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing ratherthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some longrambling circumlocution in response.Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who lookssomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restrainingorders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issuerestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who theythink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restrainingorders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file arestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that shecountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would haveallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.One of the junior reps noted that "this is America" and we have to becertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujugareiterated this, saying that "people who abuse smaller people can goto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equatingconviction with a restraining order."  (Point and match, Senator.)Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know hiscitizenship "expired every 5 years," and that a driver's license was aprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justicesystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and publichangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a deathpenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored publichangings.  The speaker then responded, "I'll make you a deal.  You getme the rope, and I'll tie the noose."Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teachertestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that "hewouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he wasoutside" without his evil gun.  She said that the "loophole" should beclosed to prevent something like this from "ever happening again".Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one ofspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actuallyshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,saying, "As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us aresafe -- support gun control."  The committee was reluctant to grill orcorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who hadclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  "Only residents can getFID's," he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had noidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cutout-of-staters completely off?)Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill aswritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed byout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT couldbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundarysomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacinounderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a residentstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mentalrecord.One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buya gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was "elitist".  Another(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residentsfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the unionhad "FID-type" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's homestate was "not enough."  One pro-gun speaker replied that thisresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!"All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimonyfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when theother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (andGOAL's position) were:o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pulllicenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (stronglyopposed)o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws(opposed)o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remainingpro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a triggerlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licenseeto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems."The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, itcould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.
