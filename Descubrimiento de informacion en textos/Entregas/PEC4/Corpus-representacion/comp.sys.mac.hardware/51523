I found out why later on when Itried to get a repair done at an Apple registered repair center - the CPU was aresale. The serial number had been removed and replaced with a non-standardnumber (probably from CDA computers). Consequently, the Apple repair man couldnot do ANY warrenty repairs. So I ended up with just a 90day warrenty from CDAover the Apple 12month warrenty. Boy, was I pi**ed! Moral of the story, CAVEATEMPTOR.However, if you go with a reliable, trustworthy mail order firm (if they exist- maybe someone could enlighten us with their experiences), you will probablyget a better price than your local educational outlet simply because mail orderout of state does not REQUIRE sales tax yet. Though for how much longer remainsto be seen. The addition in sales tax on a CPU purchase will probably wipe outan educational discount. Again CAVEAT EMPTOR, some mail order companies DOinclude sales tax on purchases even if they are out of state, so check!Richard.\\\\/  Richard J Appleyard  f0975893@jaguar.csc.wsu.edu/o o\  Washington State University(   ) ) Voice (509) 335-7728  Fax (509) 335-9688\_o_/  "To err is human, but to really screw things up takes a computer!"
