I recently purchased a Centris 610 and am having difficulty gettingmy computer to recognize my hard disk drive (external) Using both thedisk uitily of TMS (Diskwriter) and Jasmine's software, neither onewill show the drive.  The drive is the only device connected to thescuzzi port. I cant find the manual to the tms pro 120 and seem toremember that it is "terminated".  Is there something else that I amdoing (or not doing) that does not allow my 610 to recognize my externaldisk drive?.thanks in advance for the information.--Eugene E.
