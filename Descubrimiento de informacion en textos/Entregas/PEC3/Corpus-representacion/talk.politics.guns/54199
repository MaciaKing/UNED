Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions aboutthe Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're "in committee".How close is that to being made law?2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any importantdifferences I missed?3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:A. S414 doesn't specify an "appeals" process to wrongful denial duringthe waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appealsprocess once the required instant background check system is established,but not before).B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approvingusing existing records (so who would I sue in "A" above to have aninaccurate record corrected?)C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a personcan convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of animmediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a "threat", nor doesit place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exceptionstatement.True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a "clean" record frombuying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?'Seems at min. a "gun counting" scheme would be needed(e.g., "John Doe owns N guns").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprisedto see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gunregistration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.Please comment.  I'm mainly interested in specific problems with the currentlegislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the meritsof any/all waiting-period bills ever proposed.MarkS || shepard@netcom.com
