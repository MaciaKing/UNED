I can'tremember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give mea strange problem.  When I held down shift during startup to disableall extensions, nothing happened. I tried it with another keyboard, usingthe same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.The shift key on the Datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. I checkedthe dipswitches and they are fine.  Try disabling your extensions and tellme if it works.I am annoyed with Datadesk.  I sent them the keyboard in the mail forinspection/repair/replacement.  The technician on the phone said theyhave a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive theinspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  Well, they have had thekeyboard for over 3 weeks and I still have gotten very little infofrom them about it. It's annoying because it cost me $12 to send themthe keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer servicelines are toll calls. Tell me if you have a similar experience.-Davidmirsky@gnu.ai.mit.edu
