Greetings. I've been seeing the word "storage" mentionedaround oscilliscopes but I'm curious, what does it mean?If my life depended on it, I'd say that it's a scope thatuses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successivetaces on the screen for some unit of time - "store" them.Do I get to live?Also, I've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scopesince my Tek 514A (portable...NOT!) and my Heathkit O-1000are all single trace and I need more... like 2 or 3 and atleast 50MHz (maybe 100...)During my shopping at hamfests etc. I've run into theproblem of "old scope" terminology. I can imagine whata "mainframe" and "plug-in" are but some things likethe above "storage", "coax input" (Hey, where do I get aprobe that fits this? I had to fiddle with mine for a weekbefore I got anything resembling "a good trace" - they allcome with BNC connectors!), "unblanking" (huh?), and, oh,just like my 514 manuals, MANY changes were made along theway to the schematic - scopes, even with IDENTICAL modelnumbers, have different (better?) response/performance thanothers - how can I pick the better one? Does the rule of thehigher SN the better apply?Take care.--/ Filip "I'll buy a vowel" Gieszczykiewicz. | Best e-mail "fmgst+@pitt.edu"  \| All ideas are mine but they can be yours for only $0.99 so respond NOW!!!! || I live for my EE major, winsurfing, programming, SCA, and assorted dreams. |\ 200MB Drive - Linux has 100MB and MS-DOS has 100MB.
