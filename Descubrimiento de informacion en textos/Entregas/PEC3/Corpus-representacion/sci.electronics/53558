In article <1qi8e3$b5e@lll-winken.llnl.gov>, you say:>>I would like to digitize the output of a SQUID magnetometer (range -10 V>to +10 V) and do digital signal processing in a computer, say a Macintosh>II or a 486 PC.  I would like a good 16 bit ADC with good linearity and a>high conversion speed, at least 50 kHz, preferably 200 kHz.  Other concerns>>(2)  Must I use an ADC external to my computer to avoid digital noise>     feedback into my sensitive SQUID electronics?Might be a good idea...  The resolution you requested is about 0.3mVIn order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower thanthat.  It is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expectinside a PC.Before you pay $$$ for a PC card, test it out by sampling a lowdistortion sine wave (I think there is a sine wave on a CD.  DigitalDomain ?  There are possibly other low THD sources)  Run the digitizedwaveform through a FFT transform and take alook at the noise floor onthe spectrum.  That's should give you a good indication of the design.(That's what I am doing to test a data acquistion system I have designed- I got the idea from MAXIM data sheet.)If you can live with 14 bit resolution, I would recommend looking atthe MAX121 from MAXIM.  It is a high speed (308KHz) completesampling A/D with DSP interface.  The input range is +/- 5V and ituses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolatedfrom the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  The Analog designguide I got from them shows a -100db noise level.  They claim a -77dbmax (-85 typ.) THD.  Looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 piecesA evaluation kit is available.  Might want to give these nice folks acall.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000for application assistance.This assumes that you can build your own DAS and write your own software.(Hey you can get the MAX121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)>I would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a Mac or PC->based ADC system.I would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten outof your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might bethrowing out your money.>Charles Cunningham>cec@imager.llnl.govK. C. LeeElec. Eng. Grad. StudentI have no connection with MAXIM except I do in general recommendcompanies that give samples to students to others.  I feel theydeserve that for being nice to me.
