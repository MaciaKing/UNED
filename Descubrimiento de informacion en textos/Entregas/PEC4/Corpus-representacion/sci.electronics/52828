Thedetector detectors work by picking up IF re-radiated from your radardetector. In Britain, where one has/used to pay for a TV licence, thereare/were TV detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn'tpaid their licence fee. They had a couple of long solenoid antennae on theroof, and I believe could triangulate an operating TV from the IF.I wonder how much of the IF is radiated back from the detector antenna, andhow much from the rest of the module. It might be worth putting the detectorin a proper RF shielded enclosure.--Andrew Daviel, Vancouver, Canada <advax@triumf.ca>finger advax@reg.triumf.ca for PGP key
