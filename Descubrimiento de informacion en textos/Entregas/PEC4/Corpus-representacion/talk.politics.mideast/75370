The atrocities committed by the Armenianvolunteer forces accompanying the Russian army were so severe that theRussian commanders themselves were compelled to withdraw them from thefighting fronts and sent them to rear guard duties. The memoirs of manyRussian officers who served in the east at this time are filled withaccounts of the revolting atrocities committed by these Armenianguerrillas, which were savage even by relatively primitive standards ofwar then observed in such areas.[1]"[1] "Journal de Guerre du Deuxieme d'Artillerie de Forteresse Russed'Erzeroum," 1919, p. 28.: >honored me by reproducing my text.

To one brought up, as most Americans havebeen, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition ofthe Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religiousdifferences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as theywere combined with aspirations for a political separation which everynation in the world would have treated as treasonable.

In 1941,while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentrationcamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenianbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion hadgrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of theformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of theshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of thecold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Partyleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged bythis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsedand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as themembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy ofextermination of the Jews.This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an "encore"performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed andexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granteda respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the MudrosArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decidedto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian provinceof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatoliaclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as ithad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly setabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, whocould be expected to oppose their plans.On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilianand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The Britishplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, eventhough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but theBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate ofthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlierin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destructionof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks ofKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety affordedby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had leftthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, fewEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One Britishsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise thedisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring.Rawlinson wired to his superiors,"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left inindependent command of the Moslim population, as, their troopsbeing without discipline and not being under effective control,atrocities were constantly being committed.">Instead, you post more Armenian nonsense:Come again?: "These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...>(34 lines deleted)Why?: No wonder you are in such a mess.
