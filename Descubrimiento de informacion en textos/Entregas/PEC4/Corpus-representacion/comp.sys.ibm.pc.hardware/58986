Howdy,Sorry if this has been covered before:One of my PC illiterate friends asked me to help him install DRDOS 6.0 on hisNEC Powermate SX (386SX 16).  Of course, I said "No problem" and went to work.Unfortunately, the DRDOS refuses to recognize the hard drive duringinstallation, even though I am still able to boot off of the hard drive usingthe old DOS.  After openning it up I discovered it was using an 8-bitSeagate SCSI controller on a ST-157N SCSI 40Mbtye drive.  I then bootedwith DRDOS 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see ifI could access the drive.  Lo and behold the primary 46.5 Mbyte partitionwas intact (created by DOS 3.1 no less, I didn't think you could go over a32Mbyte partition in the older DOSes. I could be wrong...).  I then triedto remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  I amunaware of anything special that has to be done with a SCSI drive (Ikinda expected it to work just like an IDE/MFM/RLL drive for DOSinstallations).  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for"Throw it in the garbage and buy a new PC")...Thanks in advance,Paul "Mr. SCSI... NOT!" Fincke
