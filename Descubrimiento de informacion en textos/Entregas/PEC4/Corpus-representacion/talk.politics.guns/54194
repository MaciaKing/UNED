Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-timeLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behindthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifleor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And "snipers"too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) butthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything thatpretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feelsit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (evenviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totallyout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring waron its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other eliteswho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel theneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a militaryboot.  People do things like that because they have become convincedthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievancesredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element thatwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has beenunresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuseto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of agovernment going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simplysquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievancesin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just tooinconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep themin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange thingsso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that arethan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn'tPROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...Unbelievable.And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main guninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among manyexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sourcesof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such asgunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,and could be explained by "musta been a gas leak... ".  I think it could bedone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It isnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turningand firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossibleto cover up.>--John L.
