Anyone know how they work?Keywords: NuclearOrganisation: University of Technology, Sydney, AustraliaI really don't know where to post this question so I figured thatthis board would be most appropriate.I was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders thatare ever present at nuclear poer sites. They look like cylindersthat have been pinched in the middle. Does anybody know what theactual purpose of those things are?. I hear that they're called'Cooling Towers' but what the heck do they cool?I hope someone can help
